=== Raw Reply ===
Okay, I need to optimize the given CUDA kernel for the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 based on the provided strategies. Let me start by understanding the problem and the strategies.

The task is to optimize the 3D tensor-matrix multiplication, which is currently using PyTorch's matmul. The goal is to replace this with a custom CUDA kernel applying the listed strategies. The target architecture is Turing, so TF32 isn't supported, but FP16 and INT8 are. However, the problem mentions using float4 vector loads, so maybe the data is in FP32.

Looking at the strategies, the key points are:

1. **Tiling**: Use 2D blocks (32x8) with tile sizes BLOCK_M=16, BLOCK_N=16, BLOCK_K=4. Wait, but some strategies suggest increasing BLOCK_M to 32 and BLOCK_N to 16. Hmm, need to check which one takes precedence. The first strategy says 16x16, but another says increase to 32 and 16. Maybe the latter is better for minimizing memory accesses. Let me see the shared memory allocation. The shared memory per block is 32KB. Let's calculate the required shared memory for A and B tiles. 

   For A: Each thread block's tile is BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K. If using 32x4, then each A tile is 32x4 elements (assuming FP32, 4 bytes each). So 32*4*4 = 512 bytes. Similarly for B: BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N (4x16) → 4*16*4 = 256 bytes. Total per block would be 512 + 256 = 768 bytes, which is way under 32KB. Wait, but maybe the strategies mention 32KB for both A and B. Wait the strategy says "Allocate 32KB shared memory per block for A/B tiles with 16B alignment". So perhaps the tiles are larger. Maybe I need to adjust the tile sizes to fit within 32KB. Let me recalculate.

   Let me think again. The strategies mention using 2D block (32x8) and tile sizes BLOCK_M=16, BLOCK_N=16, BLOCK_K=4. Wait, perhaps the first strategy is the primary one. But another strategy says to increase BLOCK_M to 32 and N to 16. Maybe that's better. Let me check the shared memory required for those. 

   Suppose BLOCK_M=32, BLOCK_N=16, BLOCK_K=4. Then the A tile is 32x4 (each thread block's M and K dimensions?), and B is 4x16. So A's size is 32*4 *4 bytes = 512, B's is 4*16*4 = 256. Total 768 bytes. That's way under 32KB. So maybe the 32KB is for both tiles. Wait, perhaps the strategy wants to split the shared memory between A and B. Maybe the 32KB is the total, so each can have up to 16KB? Not sure. Maybe the initial strategy's tile sizes are okay. Alternatively, perhaps the later strategy's suggestion of increasing M to 32 and N to 16 is better. Let me proceed with that.

2. **Shared Memory Allocation**: 32KB per block, 16B aligned. So need to allocate shared memory for A and B tiles. The alignment is important to prevent bank conflicts. The vector loads (float4) require 16B alignment, so the shared memory arrays must be aligned.

3. **Vectorization**: Use float4 loads for A and B. This requires that the data is 16B aligned. The strategy mentions padding the tensors to 16B boundaries at launch. So in the host code, we need to ensure that A and B are aligned. For PyTorch tensors, maybe using pinned memory or using a custom allocator. The user mentioned using torch.pinned_memory or external alignment. So in the launcher, we might need to pad the input tensors if necessary. But how to do that in PyTorch? Alternatively, in the kernel, check alignment and use a fallback path if not aligned. But the strategy says to pad at launch, so perhaps the host code should handle that.

4. **Coalesced Access**: Order threads along row-major for A (so that threads in a warp read contiguous memory) and column-major for B. This requires careful indexing in the kernel.

5. **Guard with lane predication**: In the K-loop, when the loop is near the end, some threads might access out of bounds. Need to use predication to avoid that.

6. **Double Buffering**: For the K dimension, use two stages to hide latency. So when loading the next tile, the previous computation can proceed. This requires storing two tiles of A and B in shared memory, alternating between them.

7. **Unrolling**: Unroll the inner K-loop (BLOCK_K=4) to reduce overhead. Also, unroll the outer M and N loops by a factor of 2. So the loops over M and N (the tiles) can be unrolled.

8. **Grid Size**: Compute grid as ceil(N/BLOCK_M) * ceil(L/BLOCK_N). Wait, the output is (N, M, L). Wait, the original function's A is (N, M, K), B is (K, L). The result is (N, M, L). So the grid needs to cover all N, M, and L dimensions. Wait, perhaps the grid dimensions are (ceil(N / BLOCK_N?), ...) Hmm, maybe the grid is in terms of the tiles. Let me think: the output C has dimensions N x M x L. The tile size for M is BLOCK_M (like 32) and L is BLOCK_N (16). So the grid dimensions would be (ceil(N / 1), ceil(M / BLOCK_M), ceil(L / BLOCK_N)). But since N is 16, which is small, maybe the grid is in 2D? The strategies mention grid size as ceil(N/BLOCK_M)*ceil(L/BLOCK_N). Wait, perhaps the grid is 2D where each block handles a tile of M and L. So the block dimensions are (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N), but the grid is (ceil(M/BLOCK_M), ceil(L/BLOCK_N)), and the N dimension is handled by each block processing all N elements? Wait, the original problem is a batched matrix multiply where each batch is N. So perhaps the kernel is designed to process each batch element independently, so the grid can be per batch? Or maybe the kernel is structured to handle all N elements in parallel. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of the kernel structure.

The original code uses torch.matmul(A, B), which for A (N, M, K) and B (K, L) would compute for each n in N, the matrix multiply of A[n] (MxK) with B (KxL), resulting in MxL. So the kernel needs to process each batch (n) separately. 

To structure the kernel efficiently, perhaps each block handles a tile of the MxL output matrix for a single batch. But with N=16, which is small, maybe the kernel can process all batches in parallel. Alternatively, the grid could be per batch. Let me think of the kernel's thread organization.

The strategies mention using a 2D block (32x8) or adjusted to 16x8. Let's go with the later strategy's block dimensions of 16x8 (since one strategy says to reduce to 128 threads, 16x8 is 128). 

The tile sizes would be BLOCK_M=32, BLOCK_N=16, BLOCK_K=4. Wait, but the block dimensions are 16x8. How does that map to the tile? Each thread block processes a tile of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N (32x16). So each thread in the block would handle a portion of that. For example, with 16x8 threads, each thread could handle 2 elements in M and 2 in N? Or maybe each thread handles a single element but with vector loads. 

Alternatively, the block's threads are arranged to cover the tile. For example, each thread is responsible for a small part of the tile. The exact indexing needs to be carefully designed.

Now, the shared memory allocation: the A tile is of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K (32x4) and B is BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N (4x16). So the shared memory for A would be 32*4 elements (float), and B is 4*16 elements. Each element is 4 bytes, so total is (32*4 + 4*16)*4 bytes = (128 + 64)*4 = 192*4 = 768 bytes. That's way under 32KB, so there's room for double buffering. Since the strategy mentions double buffering for K dimension, we need two copies of A and B tiles. So the shared memory would need to hold two A tiles and two B tiles. Let's see:

Each A tile is 32x4 → 128 elements. Two of them would be 256 elements → 256 *4 = 1024 bytes. Similarly for B: 4x16 → 64 elements, two copies → 128 elements → 512 bytes. Total is 1536 bytes, still under 32KB. So that's feasible.

The double buffering would allow loading the next tile while processing the current one, hiding memory latency.

Next, the vectorization: using float4 loads requires that the data is 16-byte aligned. The strategy says to pad the input tensors to 16B boundaries. So in the host code, before launching the kernel, we need to ensure that A and B are aligned. For PyTorch tensors, perhaps using pinned memory (which is 4KB aligned, but maybe not 16B). Alternatively, we can pad the tensors with extra elements to make their addresses aligned. Alternatively, in the kernel, check the alignment and use a scalar path if not aligned. But the strategy says to pad at launch, so the host should handle it. 

In PyTorch, to get aligned memory, perhaps using .pin_memory() which ensures page-aligned memory, but 16B alignment is stricter. Alternatively, we can use a custom allocator, but that might be complex. Alternatively, in the kernel, when loading, check if the address is aligned, and if not, use scalar loads. But the strategy says to pad, so maybe the host code pads the tensors to have aligned strides. For example, the stride of A's K dimension (since it's (N, M, K)), the stride for K should be a multiple of 4 (since float4 is 4 elements). Wait, the stride for K in A is the step between elements along K. To use vector loads, the data must be aligned. So for A's K dimension, the data should be aligned to 16 bytes. 

Alternatively, the tensors can be padded such that their data pointers are 16B aligned. For example, when allocating, add padding at the beginning. But in PyTorch, this might require creating a new tensor with the correct alignment. 

Alternatively, in the kernel, when loading A and B, we can use __ldg (if using compute capability >= 3.5) for global loads, but the alignment is still required. 

Hmm, perhaps in the kernel code, we can handle misalignment by using a fallback to scalar loads if the address isn't aligned. But the strategy says to pad at launch, so the host should ensure alignment. 

Now, the kernel structure outline:

The kernel will process tiles of the output C matrix. Each block handles a tile of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N (32x16). The grid is set to cover all tiles in the M and L dimensions. Since the output is (N, M, L), each batch (N) must be processed. So the grid dimensions would be (N, grid_m, grid_l), where grid_m = ceil(M / BLOCK_M), grid_l = ceil(L / BLOCK_N). But the block dimensions are 16x8, so the block's threads need to map to the tile's elements.

Wait, perhaps the block is 16x8 threads, so each thread is responsible for a portion of the tile. For a 32x16 tile, each thread could handle 2x2 elements? Or maybe each thread handles a single element but with vector operations. 

Alternatively, the threads are arranged in a way that each thread processes a row or column in the tile. 

The computation is a matrix multiply of A's tile (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and B's tile (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N), resulting in a BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N tile of C. 

The steps in the kernel would be:

1. Load the current tile of A and B into shared memory. Use double buffering to load the next tile while computing the current one.

2. Compute the tile of C using the tiles from A and B in shared memory.

3. Write the result back to global memory.

The K loop is over the BLOCK_K tiles. Since K is 2048, and BLOCK_K is 4, the total number of K iterations is 2048 /4 = 512. The K loop is unrolled (strategy says unroll the inner K-loop of 4). So the code would have four iterations of the K loop, each processing a tile of A and B.

Wait, the strategy says to unroll the inner K-loop (BLOCK_K=4). So the loop over the K dimension (the innermost loop) is unrolled. That would eliminate loop overhead for the K dimension.

Additionally, the outer loops over M and N (the tiles) might be unrolled by a factor of 2. So for example, the M loop (over tiles) could be unrolled to process two tiles at a time. But I need to see how that's implemented.

Now, the shared memory allocation:

We need two stages (double buffering) for A and B. So:

__shared__ float s_A[2][BLOCK_M * BLOCK_K]; // two stages, each holding a tile of A
__shared__ float s_B[2][BLOCK_K * BLOCK_N]; // two stages, each holding a tile of B

Wait, but the size would be 2*(32*4 + 4*16) = 2*(128 + 64) = 384 elements, which is 384*4 = 1536 bytes. Well under 32KB. So that's okay.

The double buffering would involve loading the next tile into the second stage while processing the first, then swap pointers.

Now, the thread indices:

Each thread in the block (16x8) needs to load parts of A and B into shared memory. For A, which is a tile of 32x4, each thread can load a portion. For example, each thread could load a row of A. Since there are 16 threads in the x direction, each thread could handle 2 rows (since 32 rows / 16 threads = 2 rows per thread). Similarly for B's columns.

Wait, the block is 16x8 threads. Let's say the block's x dimension is 16, y is 8. For A's tile (32 rows, 4 columns), each thread in the x direction (16 threads) can handle 2 rows (since 32/16=2). Each thread would load 2 rows of A's current tile. The columns (4) can be handled via vector loads (float4). So each thread's x index is threadIdx.x, and the row is 2*threadIdx.x + 0 or 1. The column is threadIdx.y (since there are 8 threads in y, but the columns are 4, so maybe each thread handles 0.5 columns? Hmm, perhaps better to use the y dimension for columns. Wait, the B tile is 4x16 (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N). For B, the rows are 4 (BLOCK_K), columns 16 (BLOCK_N). So for B, each thread in the y direction (8 threads) can handle 2 columns (since 16/8=2). 

Alternatively, the threads can be arranged such that each thread is responsible for a specific element in the tile. But with vector loads, perhaps the threads can load multiple elements at once.

Let me think of the A loading:

Each thread in the block is responsible for loading a portion of the A tile. Since A is 32 rows (BLOCK_M) and 4 columns (BLOCK_K), each thread can load a row or part of a row. Since we're using float4 (4 elements), each thread can load a row of 4 elements (since each row has 4 elements). Wait, each row of A has K elements, but the tile is BLOCK_K=4. So each row in the A tile has 4 elements. So a row can be loaded as a single float4. 

So for A's tile, each row is 4 elements. Each thread can load one row. Since there are 32 rows, and 16 threads in x, each thread can handle 2 rows. So for threadIdx.x from 0 to 15, each thread handles rows 2*x and 2*x+1. The y dimension (8) might not be needed here. Wait, but the block is 16x8, so threadIdx.y can be used for other purposes. Maybe the y dimension is used for the B tile.

Alternatively, the threads can be divided into groups. For example, each thread in the block is responsible for a specific element in the tile. But with vectorization, perhaps the code can be structured to use the vector loads efficiently.

Alternatively, the A tile is loaded by each thread in the block as follows:

Each thread's x index (0-15) corresponds to a row in the A tile. Since there are 32 rows, two threads can handle two rows each. Wait, 16 threads can handle 32 rows if each thread does two rows. But each row is 4 elements (BLOCK_K=4), so each thread can load two rows via two float4 loads. 

Wait, each row is 4 elements (since the tile's K dimension is 4). So a row can be loaded with a single float4. So for two rows, a thread would do two float4 loads. 

So for A's loading:

for (int row = threadIdx.x * 2; row < (threadIdx.x +1)*2; row += 1) {
   float4* a_ptr = (float4*)(A_global + row * stride_A);
   s_A[stage][row * BLOCK_K + col] = ... 
}

Hmm, perhaps the code would have each thread handle two rows of A. The column is 0-3 (since BLOCK_K=4). Wait, but the columns are the K dimension. Each row in the A tile has 4 elements (since it's a tile of K=4). So each row is exactly 4 elements, which fits a float4. 

Therefore, each thread can load two rows (since 32 rows / 16 threads = 2 per thread). The column is covered by the float4.

So for each thread in the x dimension (0-15):

row_start = 2 * threadIdx.x

row0 = row_start

row1 = row_start +1

Each thread loads row0 and row1 into shared memory. 

The same applies for B's tile. B is 4 rows (BLOCK_K) and 16 columns (BLOCK_N). Each row has 16 elements. To load this with float4, each row can be divided into 4 elements per float4. So each row has 16 elements → 4 float4s. 

The B tile's rows are 4 (BLOCK_K), so each thread in the y dimension (since there are 8 threads in y) can handle half a row? Not sure. Alternatively, each thread can handle a portion of the columns. 

Alternatively, for B's loading, each thread can handle a column. Since there are 16 columns (BLOCK_N=16), and 8 threads in y, each thread can handle 2 columns. 

Wait, the B tile is 4 rows (BLOCK_K) by 16 columns (BLOCK_N). Each column is 4 elements (since rows are 4). So each column can be loaded as a float4. 

Each thread in the y dimension (0-7) can handle two columns (since 16 columns /8 threads = 2 per thread). 

So for B's loading:

for (int col = threadIdx.y * 2; col < (threadIdx.y +1)*2; col++) {
   float4* b_ptr = (float4*)(B_global + col * stride_B);
   // load into shared memory
}

This way, each thread handles two columns of B's tile. 

Now, the shared memory indices:

For A's shared memory, the layout is [BLOCK_M][BLOCK_K], stored as a 1D array. So s_A[stage][row * BLOCK_K + col].

For B's shared memory, it's [BLOCK_K][BLOCK_N], so s_B[stage][row * BLOCK_N + col].

Wait, but B is stored as row-major, so each row is contiguous. So for B's tile, the rows are 4 (BLOCK_K) and columns 16 (BLOCK_N). So the B tile's row-major storage would be row0 (16 elements), row1 (16), etc. 

Now, the computation:

The C tile is computed as the sum over k of A's row * B's column. 

Each thread computes a part of the C tile. The C tile is BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N (32x16). Each thread in the block (16x8) can compute a portion. For example, each thread handles 2 rows (in M) and 2 columns (in N). 

Wait, with 16x8 threads, total 128 threads. The C tile has 32*16 = 512 elements. So each thread needs to compute 4 elements (512 /128 =4). 

Alternatively, each thread computes a 2x2 block. 

The computation would be done in a loop over the K tiles (each of size BLOCK_K=4). Since the K loop is unrolled (4 iterations), the code would have four iterations of the computation for each K tile. 

The double buffering would involve loading the next K tile into the second stage while computing the current one. 

Now, putting this all together in code:

The kernel would have:

- Shared memory for A and B tiles, with two stages.

- The grid dimensions are (N, grid_m, grid_l), where grid_m = ceil(M / BLOCK_M), grid_l = ceil(L / BLOCK_N). 

Wait, the output is (N, M, L). Each block processes a tile of M and L. So for each batch n in N, the block's grid is (grid_m, grid_l). But since N is 16, the grid would need to have N as a dimension. So the grid dimensions would be (N, grid_m, grid_l). The block dimensions are (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) → no, the block is 16x8 threads. 

Wait, the block dimensions are 16x8 threads. The grid is set such that each block handles a tile of M and L. 

The block's thread indices are threadIdx.x and threadIdx.y. 

The kernel's parameters would include pointers to A and B, and the output C. Also, the dimensions N, M, K, L, and strides for A and B. 

The kernel code outline:

__global__ void matmul_kernel(float* __restrict__ C, const float* __restrict__ A, const float* __restrict__ B, int N, int M, int K, int L, int stride_A, int stride_B, int stride_C) {

   // Calculate the tile indices
   int batch = blockIdx.x;
   int tile_m = blockIdx.y;
   int tile_n = blockIdx.z;

   // Compute the starting indices in M and L
   int m_start = tile_m * BLOCK_M;
   int l_start = tile_n * BLOCK_N;

   // Thread indices within the block
   int tx = threadIdx.x;
   int ty = threadIdx.y;

   // Shared memory for A and B tiles, with two stages
   __shared__ float s_A[2][BLOCK_M * BLOCK_K];
   __shared__ float s_B[2][BLOCK_K * BLOCK_N];

   // Initialize the C tile's portion for this thread
   float c[2][2] = {0.0f}; // assuming each thread computes 2x2 elements

   // Double buffering variables
   int stage = 0;
   int k_block = 0;

   for (int k_outer = 0; k_outer < K; k_outer += BLOCK_K) {
      // Load A and B tiles into shared memory
      // ... code to load A and B tiles into s_A[stage] and s_B[stage]

      // Synchronize to ensure tiles are loaded
      __syncthreads();

      // Compute the tile contribution for this K block
      for (int k = 0; k < BLOCK_K; ++k) {
          // Unroll the K loop (BLOCK_K=4)
          #pragma unroll
          for (int kk = 0; kk < BLOCK_K; ++kk) {
              // Compute the contributions for each element in the C tile
              // using s_A and s_B
          }
      }

      // Swap stages for double buffering
      stage ^= 1;

      // Synchronize again before next iteration
      __syncthreads();
   }

   // Write the computed C tile back to global memory
   // ... code to write c[...] to C
}

Wait, but the K loop is unrolled, so the inner loop over k would be replaced by four iterations. 

Alternatively, since the K loop is unrolled (BLOCK_K=4), the code would have four iterations of the K loop, each handling a k value from 0 to 3. 

Now, the loading of A and B into shared memory:

For A:

Each thread is responsible for loading a portion of the A tile. Since the A tile is 32 rows (BLOCK_M) ×4 columns (BLOCK_K), and the block has 16 threads in x and 8 in y, perhaps the x dimension handles rows and y handles columns. 

Wait, each thread's x index can handle rows. For example, each thread in x (0-15) can handle 2 rows (since 32 rows /16 threads =2). The y dimension (0-7) can handle the columns (4 columns, so each thread can handle 0.5 columns? Not sure. Alternatively, since each row is 4 elements (BLOCK_K=4), which is exactly a float4, each thread can load a row as a float4. 

So for each row in the A tile:

row = 2 * tx + 0 or 1 (since each thread handles two rows)

for (int row_offset = 0; row_offset < 2; row_offset++) {
   int row = 2 * tx + row_offset;
   if (row >= BLOCK_M) continue; // in case of partial tiles
   float4* a_ptr = (float4*)(A + batch * A_batch_stride + (m_start + row) * A_row_stride + k_outer);
   s_A[stage][row * BLOCK_K + 0] = a_ptr[0]; // assuming 4 elements per row
}

Wait, the A tensor is (N, M, K). So for a given batch, the row in M is m_start + row. The K dimension is k_outer to k_outer+BLOCK_K-1. 

The A's pointer for a given batch, m, k is A[batch][m][k]. The stride for A's K dimension would be 1 (since it's contiguous), but the row stride (M dimension) is K elements. 

Wait, the stride for A's M dimension (rows) is K elements. So the row stride is K. 

So the A pointer for a given batch, m, k is:

A + batch * M*K + m * K + k 

So for the tile starting at k_outer, the A pointer for row 'row' (within the tile's M) is:

A_global = A + batch * M*K + (m_start + row) * K + k_outer;

The float4 load would read four consecutive elements starting at that address. 

So each thread's x index handles two rows. The y dimension isn't used here, but since the block is 16x8, maybe the y is used for other parts. 

Wait, perhaps the y dimension is used for the B tile loading. 

For B's loading:

The B tile is 4 rows (BLOCK_K) ×16 columns (BLOCK_N). Each row has 16 elements (since L is 768, but the tile is 16 columns). 

Each thread in the y dimension (0-7) can handle two columns (since 16 columns /8 threads =2 per thread). 

So for each column in the B tile:

col = 2 * ty + 0 or 1 

for (int col_offset = 0; col_offset < 2; col_offset++) {
   int col = 2 * ty + col_offset;
   if (col >= BLOCK_N) continue;
   float4* b_ptr = (float4*)(B + (k_outer + kk) * B_row_stride + l_start + col);
   // load into s_B[stage][ ... ]
}

Wait, B is (K, L), so the row stride is L. The B pointer for row k and column l is B + k * L + l. 

So for the B tile starting at k_outer, the row is k_outer + kk (since the K loop is over k_outer in steps of BLOCK_K). Wait, no, the K loop is over the entire K dimension in chunks of BLOCK_K. So for each k_outer, the current tile is k_outer to k_outer + BLOCK_K -1. 

Wait, the B tile for the current K block (k_outer) would be rows from k_outer to k_outer + BLOCK_K -1. 

So for B's row 'row_b' (0 to 3, since BLOCK_K=4), the global row is k_outer + row_b. 

The column is l_start + col. 

So the B pointer for row_b and column col is:

B_global = B + (k_outer + row_b) * L + (l_start + col);

But since B is stored in row-major, each row is contiguous. 

To load this into shared memory, each thread in the y dimension can handle two columns. 

Putting this together, the code for loading A and B into shared memory would involve loops over the rows and columns, using float4 loads where possible. 

Now, the computation part:

Each thread computes a portion of the C tile. The C tile is 32x16. Each thread in the block (16x8) can compute a 2x2 block (since 32/16=2 rows, 16/8=2 columns). 

The thread's position in the block is (tx, ty). The C element indices within the tile are:

c_row = tx * 2 + 0 or 1 

c_col = ty * 2 + 0 or 1 

Wait, perhaps each thread handles a 2x2 block. So for each of the four elements in the block, the thread computes the sum over k of A's row * B's column. 

The computation would loop over the K tiles (each of size 4), and within each, loop over the 4 elements of the current K block. 

But since the K loop is unrolled (BLOCK_K=4), the code would have four iterations for each K block. 

The computation for each element (c_row, c_col) in the C tile would be:

for (int k = 0; k < BLOCK_K; ++k) {
    float a_val = s_A[stage][c_row * BLOCK_K + k];
    float b_val = s_B[stage][k * BLOCK_N + c_col];
    c[...] += a_val * b_val;
}

But since this is done for each K block, and the K loop is unrolled, the code would have four iterations of this. 

Wait, but the double buffering requires that while computing the current K block, the next is being loaded. 

Putting all this together is quite involved. Now, considering the host code:

The host code must launch the kernel with the correct grid and block dimensions. 

The block dimensions are (16, 8) as per the strategy to reduce thread count to 128. 

The grid dimensions are (N, grid_m, grid_l), where grid_m = ceil(M / BLOCK_M), grid_l = ceil(L / BLOCK_N). 

For the given problem, M=1024, so grid_m = 1024 /32 =32. L=768, so grid_l =768/16=48. So the grid is (16, 32, 48). 

The kernel launch would be:

matmul_kernel<<<dim3(N, grid_m, grid_l), dim3(16,8)>>>(...);

Now, the host code must also handle padding the tensors to 16B alignment. 

In PyTorch, to ensure alignment, perhaps we can use pinned memory and check the data pointers. Alternatively, we can pad the tensors with extra elements to make their addresses aligned. 

Alternatively, in the kernel, when loading A and B, check if their pointers are aligned. If not, use scalar loads. But the strategy says to pad at launch, so the host should handle it. 

In the host code, before launching the kernel, we can do:

A_padded = A.contiguous() # Ensure it's contiguous
B_padded = B.contiguous()

But this may not ensure 16B alignment. To get aligned memory, perhaps using .pin_memory() which ensures page alignment (which is 4KB, so 16B is a subset). 

Alternatively, we can use a custom allocator, but in PyTorch, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, in the kernel, when loading, use __ldg (if supported) which can handle misalignment, but requires that the data is in global memory. 

Alternatively, the code can check the alignment and use a fallback path. 

But according to the strategy, we should pad at launch. So perhaps the host code pads the tensors by adding a few elements to the beginning to make the data pointer aligned. 

For example, to align A's data pointer to 16 bytes:

alignment = 16
data_ptr = A.data_ptr()
padding = (alignment - (data_ptr % alignment)) % alignment
if padding >0:
    A_padded = torch.empty(A.size(0), A.size(1), A.size(2)+padding, dtype=A.dtype, device=A.device)
    A_padded[:, :, padding:] = A
    A = A_padded
    # adjust the stride accordingly

But this requires modifying the tensor's shape and stride, which might be complex. 

Alternatively, since the problem's input tensors are generated with torch.rand, which may already be aligned, but to be safe, the code can assume that the tensors are aligned and proceed. 

Now, putting all this into code:

The CUDA kernel code will have the shared memory declarations, the loading loops with vector loads, the computation loops unrolled, and the double buffering. 

The host code will launch the kernel with the correct grid and block dimensions, passing the necessary parameters like strides. 

The strides for A are:

A has shape (N, M, K). The stride for M is K elements, and for K is 1. 

So in the kernel, the stride_A for the M dimension is K, and for the K dimension is 1. 

Similarly for B (K, L), the stride for K is L, and for L is 1. 

The output C has shape (N, M, L), so the stride for M is L, and for L is 1. 

Now, the final code:

The Python script will use torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline to compile the CUDA kernel. 

The kernel code will be written in CUDA C++ inside the Python script. 

The kernel function will be declared with __global__, and the host function will be a C++ function that wraps the kernel launch. 

The ModelNew class will replace the original matmul with a call to the custom kernel. 

Now, writing the code step by step:

First, the imports:

import torch
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

Then, the CUDA source code as a string. 

The CUDA code will include the kernel and the host function. 

The kernel function:

__global__ void matmul_kernel(float* C, const float* A, const float* B, int N, int M, int K, int L, int stride_A_M, int stride_A_K, int stride_B_K, int stride_B_L, int stride_C_M, int stride_C_L) {
    // ... the kernel code as discussed
}

The host function (C++ code) to launch the kernel:

extern "C" {
    void matmul_cuda(torch::Tensor C, torch::Tensor A, torch::Tensor B) {
        const int BLOCK_M = 32;
        const int BLOCK_N = 16;
        const int BLOCK_K = 4;
        const int threads_x = 16;
        const int threads_y = 8;
        dim3 block(threads_x, threads_y);
        int grid_m = (M + BLOCK_M -1)/BLOCK_M;
        int grid_l = (L + BLOCK_N -1)/BLOCK_N;
        dim3 grid(N, grid_m, grid_l);
        matmul_kernel<<<grid, block>>>(
            C.data_ptr<float>(),
            A.data_ptr<float>(),
            B.data_ptr<float>(),
            N, M, K, L,
            A.stride(1), A.stride(2),
            B.stride(0), B.stride(1),
            C.stride(1), C.stride(2)
        );
    }
}

The source code string will include these functions. 

Now, the kernel code:

Inside the kernel:

Each thread computes its portion of the C tile. 

The shared memory:

__shared__ float s_A[2][BLOCK_M * BLOCK_K];
__shared__ float s_B[2][BLOCK_K * BLOCK_N];

The tile indices:

int batch = blockIdx.x;
int tile_m = blockIdx.y;
int tile_n = blockIdx.z;

int m_start = tile_m * BLOCK_M;
int l_start = tile_n * BLOCK_N;

The thread indices:

int tx = threadIdx.x;
int ty = threadIdx.y;

The computation variables:

float c[2][2] = {0.0f}; // assuming each thread handles 2x2 elements in C tile

The K loop:

for (int k_outer = 0; k_outer < K; k_outer += BLOCK_K) {
    // Load A and B tiles into shared memory
    // ... code for loading A and B

    __syncthreads();

    // Compute contributions for this K block
    for (int kk = 0; kk < BLOCK_K; ++kk) {
        // Unroll this loop (BLOCK_K=4)
        #pragma unroll
        for (int kk = 0; kk < 4; ++kk) {
            // compute for each element in the C tile
        }
    }

    // swap stages
    stage ^=1;
    __syncthreads();
}

Wait, but the K loop is over k_outer in steps of BLOCK_K. The kk is within the current block. 

Wait, the K loop is over the entire K dimension in chunks of BLOCK_K. For each chunk, we load the A and B tiles for that K chunk. 

The computation for each element in the C tile is the sum over all K of A[m][k] * B[k][l]. 

Within each K chunk (k_outer to k_outer+BLOCK_K-1), the contribution to C is the sum over k in this chunk of A[m][k] * B[k][l]. 

The shared memory holds the current chunk's A and B tiles. 

The computation for each element (c_row, c_col) in the C tile is:

for (int k = 0; k < BLOCK_K; ++k) {
    float a_val = s_A[stage][c_row * BLOCK_K + k];
    float b_val = s_B[stage][k * BLOCK_N + c_col];
    c[...] += a_val * b_val;
}

But this needs to be done for each element in the thread's portion of the C tile. 

The thread's portion of the C tile is determined by tx and ty. 

For example, each thread (tx, ty) handles:

c_row = tx * (BLOCK_M / threads_x) + ... 

Wait, with 16 threads in x and 32 rows, each thread handles 2 rows. 

Similarly, in y dimension (8 threads for 16 columns), each thread handles 2 columns. 

So for the C tile's rows and columns:

int c_row_in_tile = tx * 2 + 0 or 1 

Wait, perhaps:

int c_row = tx * 2 + 0; // first row
int c_col = ty * 2 + 0; // first column

But need to handle all combinations. 

Alternatively, each thread handles a 2x2 block:

for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; ++j) {
        int c_row = tx * 2 + i;
        int c_col = ty * 2 + j;
        if (c_row < BLOCK_M && c_col < BLOCK_N) {
            // compute contribution for this element
        }
    }
}

This way, each thread handles four elements in the C tile. 

The computation for each element would be:

for (int k = 0; k < BLOCK_K; ++k) {
    float a_val = s_A[stage][c_row * BLOCK_K + k];
    float b_val = s_B[stage][k * BLOCK_N + c_col];
    c[i][j] += a_val * b_val;
}

But since the K loop is unrolled (BLOCK_K=4), this loop can be unrolled into four iterations. 

Putting this all together is quite complex. 

Now, the loading of A and B into shared memory:

For A:

Each thread in x dimension handles two rows of the A tile. 

for (int row_offset = 0; row_offset < 2; row_offset++) {
    int row = 2 * tx + row_offset;
    if (row >= BLOCK_M) continue;
    int a_offset = batch * A.stride(0) + (m_start + row) * stride_A_M + (k_outer + kk);
    // but wait, the A's pointer is A + batch * (M*K) + (m_start + row)*K + (k_outer + kk)
    // but in terms of strides, A.stride(1) is K, A.stride(2) is 1.
    // So the offset is batch * A.stride(0) + row * A.stride(1) + (k_outer + kk) * A.stride(2)
    // which is batch * (M*K) + row*K + (k_outer + kk)
    // but in the kernel parameters, we have stride_A_M = A.stride(1) (which is K)
    // and stride_A_K = A.stride(2) (which is 1)
    int a_offset = batch * (M*K) + row * stride_A_M + (k_outer + kk) * stride_A_K;
    // but in the kernel parameters, the strides are passed as integers.
    // So the pointer is A + a_offset.

    // Load into shared memory
    s_A[stage][row * BLOCK_K + kk] = A[a_offset];
}

Wait, but using float4 loads:

float4* a_ptr = (float4*)(A + a_offset);
s_A[stage][row * BLOCK_K + 0] = a_ptr[0].x; // but this is not efficient. 

Alternatively, the entire row can be loaded as a float4:

for each row in the thread's responsibility:

int row = 2*tx + row_offset;
int a_base = batch * (M*K) + row * stride_A_M + k_outer * stride_A_K;
float4* a_ptr = (float4*)(A + a_base);
for (int kk = 0; kk < BLOCK_K; ++kk) {
    s_A[stage][row * BLOCK_K + kk] = a_ptr[kk].x; // no, this is not correct. 

Wait, the row has BLOCK_K elements (since the tile's K is BLOCK_K). So the row's data is a contiguous block of BLOCK_K floats. 

So for a row, the float4 can be loaded as:

float4* a_ptr = (float4*)(A + a_base);
for (int kk = 0; kk < BLOCK_K; kk +=4) {
    s_A[stage][row * BLOCK_K + kk] = a_ptr[kk/4].x;
    s_A[stage][row * BLOCK_K + kk+1] = a_ptr[kk/4].y;
    s_A[stage][row * BLOCK_K + kk+2] = a_ptr[kk/4].z;
    s_A[stage][row * BLOCK_K + kk+3] = a_ptr[kk/4].w;
}

But since BLOCK_K is 4, this can be done in one step:

float4 val = a_ptr[0];
s_A[stage][row * 4 + 0] = val.x;
s_A[stage][row *4 +1] = val.y;
s_A[stage][row*4+2] = val.z;
s_A[stage][row*4+3] = val.w;

This way, the entire row is loaded with a single float4 read. 

Similarly for B:

Each thread in the y dimension handles two columns of the B tile. 

For column in the thread's responsibility:

int col = 2*ty + col_offset;
int b_base = (k_outer + kk) * stride_B_K + (l_start + col);
float4* b_ptr = (float4*)(B + b_base);
for (int row_b =0; row_b < BLOCK_K; row_b++) {
    s_B[stage][row_b * BLOCK_N + col] = b_ptr[row_b * (BLOCK_N/4) + ... ] 
}

Wait, B's tile is 4 rows (BLOCK_K) ×16 columns (BLOCK_N). Each row has 16 elements. 

For a column 'col', the B's data for the current K block (k_outer) is:

for each row_b in 0..3 (BLOCK_K rows):

the element is B[(k_outer + row_b)*stride_B_K + (l_start + col)]

The B's stride for K is stride_B_K = B.stride(0) = L. 

So the base address for row_b is:

b_row_base = (k_outer + row_b) * L + l_start + col;

Wait, but the column is l_start + col. 

To load this into shared memory:

For each thread's column:

int col = 2*ty + col_offset;
for (int row_b =0; row_b < BLOCK_K; row_b++) {
    int b_offset = (k_outer + row_b)*stride_B_K + (l_start + col);
    s_B[stage][row_b * BLOCK_N + col] = B[b_offset];
}

But using vector loads:

For each row_b:

the row in B is (k_outer + row_b), and the column is l_start + col. 

The row has 16 elements (BLOCK_N=16), so for a column 'col', the data is at offset (k_outer + row_b)*L + (l_start + col). 

To load this with float4:

The column is part of the row. For example, the column is at position (l_start + col) in the row. 

Wait, the B's row is stored as a contiguous array of L elements. So for a row_b and column 'col', the offset is (k_outer + row_b)*L + (l_start + col). 

To load this into shared memory, perhaps the thread can load the entire row in chunks of 4 elements. 

Alternatively, for each row_b and column in the thread's responsibility:

int row_b = ... 

But this is getting too detailed. 

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the code as best as possible, following the strategies and ensuring correctness. 

Finally, the kernel code will be written with the shared memory, loading loops with vectorization where possible, and the computation loops unrolled. 

The final Python code will include the CUDA kernel, the host function, and the ModelNew class that uses the kernel. 

Now, putting it all together into the Python script as per the output rules.
