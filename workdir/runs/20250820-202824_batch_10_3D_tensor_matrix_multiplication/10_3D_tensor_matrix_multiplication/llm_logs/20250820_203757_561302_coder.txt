=== Raw Reply ===
Okay, I need to optimize the given PyTorch model which performs a 3D tensor-matrix multiplication using a custom CUDA kernel. The target GPU is the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 (Turing). Let me think through the steps required here.

First, the original code uses torch.matmul(A, B), where A is (N, M, K) and B is (K, L), resulting in (N, M, L). The goal is to replace this with a CUDA kernel. Since the operation is a batched matrix multiplication (each of the N*M matrices in A is multiplied by B), I should structure the kernel to handle this efficiently.

The key here is to parallelize the computation across the GPU. Each element of the output tensor C[i,j,l] is the dot product of A[i,j,:] and B[:,l]. To compute this efficiently, I can structure the kernel so that each thread block handles a single (i,j) pair, and each thread within the block computes a specific l value. Alternatively, maybe a tiled approach would be better, but given the dimensions, let's see.

The dimensions are N=16, M=1024, K=2048, L=768. So each A's slice (M x K) multiplied by B (K x L) gives M x L. Since N is small (16), maybe we can process all N slices in parallel. Wait, but the batch dimension in matmul is handled automatically. Let me think about the kernel structure.

Each output element C[i][j][l] is sum_{k} A[i][j][k] * B[k][l]. So for each (i,j,l), we need to compute this sum. To parallelize this, perhaps each thread can compute a single (j,l) pair for all i, but since N is 16, maybe it's manageable. Alternatively, each thread could handle a specific (i,j,l) triplet. But that might be too granular.

Alternatively, since the batch dimension N is small, we can process all N elements in parallel. Let's think of the problem as N separate MxK multiplied by KxL matrices, resulting in NxMxL. So for each of the N batches, we can compute an MxL matrix. So the kernel can process each batch independently. But how to structure the threads?

Alternatively, since the problem is a batched GEMM (General Matrix Multiply), maybe using CUDA's cuBLAS would be better, but the user wants a hand-written kernel. So I need to write a kernel that can handle this.

Let me think of the kernel structure. Let's consider that each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. For example, each block could handle a tile of the output matrix. Let's see:

The output is (N, M, L). Let's consider each (i,j,l) as a single element. To compute this, each thread could compute one element. But with the summation over K elements, that might be inefficient. Alternatively, each thread can compute a partial sum for a (j,l) pair, and accumulate over k.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a tiled approach where each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix. Let me think of the standard matrix multiplication kernel structure.

Alternatively, for each (i,j,l), the computation is sum_{k} A[i][j][k] * B[k][l]. To compute this, each thread can be responsible for a particular (j,l) pair and accumulate over k. Since N is 16, maybe we can process all N elements in parallel. Wait, but the N dimension is the first dimension of A. So for each (j,l), the sum over k is the same for all i. Wait no, because A[i][j][k] varies with i. So each (i,j,l) has its own sum. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to structure the kernel so that each thread block is responsible for a block of (j,l) pairs, and each thread in the block handles a particular i. Let me think:

Suppose we have a grid of blocks where each block corresponds to a (j,l) tile. Each block can process all N elements for that (j,l) tile. Wait, but the output is (N, M, L), so for each (j,l), there are N elements (one per i). So for each (j,l), the value for each i is the sum over k of A[i][j][k] * B[k][l].

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to have each thread handle a single (i,j,l) triplet, but that would require a lot of threads. Let me calculate the total number of elements in the output: N*M*L = 16 * 1024 * 768 = around 12,582,912 elements. That's manageable with CUDA threads, but the summation over K (2048 elements) per element would be expensive if done naively.

Alternatively, we can structure the kernel so that each thread computes a partial sum for a (i,j,l) and then combine them. Let's think of the following approach:

Each thread block is assigned to compute a block of (j,l) pairs. For each (j,l) in the block, and for each i in N, the thread block will compute the sum over k of A[i][j][k] * B[k][l].

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use a tiled approach where each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix. Let me think of the standard matrix multiplication approach. Let's consider that for each (j,l), the sum over k is needed. Let's think of the problem as for each (j,l), the sum over k of (A's j-th row in each batch) multiplied by B's l-th column.

Alternatively, let's structure the kernel so that each thread block is responsible for a block of (j,l) pairs, and each thread in the block handles a particular k. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of a simpler approach first.

Let me consider that for each (i,j,l), the value is the sum over k of A[i][j][k] * B[k][l]. To compute this, each thread can be responsible for a (i,j,l) triplet and compute the sum. However, this would require a lot of threads (since N*M*L is 16*1024*768 ~12.5 million), but each thread would have to loop over K=2048 elements. That would be 12.5M * 2048 operations, which is way too much. So that's not feasible.

Therefore, we need a more efficient way. The standard approach for matrix multiplication is to use a tiled approach where each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix, and each thread in the block computes a part of the tile using shared memory to hold the tiles of A and B. Let me try to adapt that here.

The problem is a batched matrix multiplication. Let's see: the input A is (N, M, K), B is (K, L). The output is (N, M, L). So for each batch i in N, we have an MxK matrix multiplied by a KxL matrix, resulting in MxL. So effectively, it's N separate matrix multiplications. So the kernel can process each batch independently, but perhaps it's better to process all batches in parallel.

Alternatively, since N is small (16), we can process all batches in parallel. Let me structure the kernel as follows:

Each thread block is responsible for a block of (j,l) in the MxL output matrix. For each such (j,l), and for each batch i, compute the sum over k of A[i][j][k] * B[k][l].

Wait, but how to structure this. Let's think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix (j,l). Let's say each block handles a block of size TILE_WIDTH x TILE_WIDTH. Each thread in the block is responsible for a (j,l) position within the tile. For each such (j,l), the thread will compute the sum over k for all batches i.

Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps each thread block can handle a tile of the output for a particular batch. Since N is small, maybe we can have N thread blocks, each handling a different batch. But that might not utilize the GPU well.

Alternatively, let's think of the problem as for each batch i, compute MxL = (MxK) * (KxL). So for each batch, it's a standard matrix multiplication. So the kernel can process each batch in parallel. Let's structure the kernel so that each batch is handled by a separate grid of blocks. But how to do that.

Alternatively, the kernel can be designed to process all batches in parallel. Let me think of the following approach:

Each thread block is responsible for a tile of the output matrix (j,l) for all batches. The block will process a tile of size TILE_WIDTH x TILE_WIDTH in the (j,l) space. Each thread in the block will handle a specific (j,l) position within the tile. For each (j,l), and for each batch i, the thread will compute the sum over k of A[i][j][k] * B[k][l].

Wait, but that would require each thread to loop over all K elements for each batch. That might be too slow. Alternatively, using shared memory to cache parts of A and B for the tile.

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to use the standard tiled matrix multiplication approach, but extended to handle all batches in parallel. Let me outline the steps:

1. Each thread block is assigned to a tile of the output matrix (j,l). The tile size is, say, 16x16.

2. For each tile, the block will load into shared memory the necessary tiles from A and B.

Wait, but since A has a batch dimension, each batch's A[i][j][k] is different. So for each batch, the A matrix is different. Therefore, the standard tiled approach can't be directly applied because the A matrices for different batches are different. So this complicates things.

Hmm, this is a problem. Because each batch's A is different, the tiled approach would require handling each batch separately. Since N is 16, maybe we can process all batches in parallel by having each thread handle a batch.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to process each batch independently. Let me think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread block is responsible for a tile of the output matrix (j,l) for a single batch. The grid is structured as N (batches) * number of tiles in M*L.

Wait, but how to structure this. Let me think of the following:

The total number of tiles in the M*L output for a single batch is (ceil(M / TILE_M) * ceil(L / TILE_L)). For each batch, we need to process that many tiles. So the grid would have N * (ceil(M / TM) * ceil(L / TL)) blocks. Each block would handle a tile for a specific batch.

Each block would then compute the tile for that batch. The block would use shared memory to cache the tiles of A and B needed for the computation.

Let me try to outline the kernel code:

Define tile dimensions, say TM=16, TL=16, and TK=32 (the tile over K). The block size would be TM * TL threads, but perhaps need to adjust.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory can be adapted here. Let's see:

For each batch i:

The output is M x L. Each block processes a tile of TM x TL in the output. The block will load tiles of A (TM x TK) and B (TK x TL) into shared memory. Each thread in the block is responsible for a (j,l) position in the tile. The loop over K is divided into chunks of TK.

So for each batch i, the block will process a tile (j_start, l_start) of size TM x TL. The threads in the block will load the A and B tiles into shared memory, then compute the partial sums for their (j,l) position.

But since we have N batches, each block must process a specific batch. So the grid would have N * (ceil(M/TM) * ceil(L/TL)) blocks. Each block is assigned to a batch and a tile.

The kernel would have parameters for the batch index, but since the grid is structured to handle all batches, each block's batch is determined by the block index.

Wait, the block index can be divided into batch and tile indices. For example, the block index can be:

blockIdx.x = batch * num_tiles + tile_idx

where num_tiles is the number of tiles per batch (ceil(M/TM) * ceil(L/TL)).

Alternatively, the grid can be structured as N blocks along the batch dimension, and each block handles all tiles for their batch. But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, the grid is divided into N groups, each group handling a batch. Each group has a number of blocks equal to the number of tiles per batch. So the total number of blocks is N * num_tiles.

Each block in the group processes a tile for that batch.

The kernel code would then be:

__global__ void batched_matmul_kernel(
    const float* A, const float* B, float* C,
    int N, int M, int K, int L,
    int lda, int ldb, int ldc) {

    // Determine batch index and tile indices
    int batch = blockIdx.x / num_tiles_per_batch;
    int tile_idx = blockIdx.x % num_tiles_per_batch;

    // Compute tile's starting j and l
    int tile_j = tile_idx / (L / TL);
    int tile_l = tile_idx % (L / TL);
    tile_j *= TM;
    tile_l *= TL;

    // ... rest of the code to compute the tile for this batch and tile
}

But this requires knowing num_tiles_per_batch, which can be precomputed.

Alternatively, compute tile_j and tile_l within the kernel based on tile_idx.

But this might get complicated. Let me think of the parameters:

The A tensor is of shape (N, M, K), so the leading dimension (stride) for A is M*K. Similarly, B is (K, L), so ldb is L. The output C is (N, M, L), so ldc is M*L.

Wait, the strides are important here. The kernel needs to know how to index into the A and B arrays.

Alternatively, the kernel can be written with the following parameters:

- A: pointer to the start of the A tensor (size N*M*K)
- B: pointer to the start of B (size K*L)
- C: pointer to the start of C (size N*M*L)
- N, M, K, L: dimensions
- lda: leading dimension of A (M*K)
- ldb: leading dimension of B (L)
- ldc: leading dimension of C (M*L)

Wait, perhaps it's better to use row-major ordering. Let me think of the memory layout:

A is stored as a contiguous array of N*M*K elements. So for a given batch i, the A[i] is a MxK matrix, stored as M rows of K elements each. So the stride between batches is M*K.

Similarly, B is a KxL matrix stored in row-major, so ldb is L.

C is a N*M*L array. Each batch's output is a MxL matrix, so the stride between batches is M*L.

So in the kernel, to access A[i][j][k], the index would be i*(M*K) + j*K + k.

Similarly, B[k][l] is at position k*L + l.

C[i][j][l] is at i*(M*L) + j*L + l.

Now, the kernel needs to process each batch's tile.

Let me proceed to write the kernel code.

First, the kernel will be launched with a grid of blocks equal to N * (ceil(M/TM) * ceil(L/TL)), and each block has a thread block size of TM * TL threads. Each thread in the block is responsible for a (j,l) position within the tile.

The tile size is TM x TL. The block will process a tile of TM rows and TL columns in the output matrix for a specific batch.

The steps for each block:

1. Determine the batch index and the tile's starting j and l.

2. Each thread in the block computes its (j,l) position within the tile.

3. For each tile of K (since K is large, we need to loop over K in chunks of TK), load the A and B tiles into shared memory.

4. Compute the partial sum for the (j,l) position in the tile.

Let me define the tile dimensions. Let's choose TM=16, TL=16, TK=32. These are typical values for matrix multiplication kernels.

The shared memory will need to hold two tiles: one for A's TMxTK and B's TKxTL. The size would be (TM + TK) * (TK + TL) or something like that. Wait, actually, the A tile is TM rows x TK columns, and the B tile is TK columns x TL rows. So the shared memory for A is TM x TK, and for B is TK x TL. So total shared memory needed is (TM*TK + TK*TL) * sizeof(float). For TM=16, TL=16, TK=32, that's (16*32 + 32*16) = 1024 floats, which is 4KB. That's acceptable since the SM has 64KB shared memory.

Now, the kernel code outline:

__global__ void batched_matmul_kernel(
    const float* __restrict__ A,
    const float* __restrict__ B,
    float* __restrict__ C,
    int N, int M, int K, int L,
    int lda, int ldb, int ldc) {

    // Determine batch and tile indices
    int batch = blockIdx.x / ( (M + TM -1)/TM * (L + TL -1)/TL );
    int tile_idx = blockIdx.x % ( (M + TM-1)/TM * (L + TL-1)/TL );

    int tile_j = (tile_idx / ((L + TL-1)/TL)) ) * TM;
    int tile_l = (tile_idx % ((L + TL-1)/TL)) ) * TL;

    // Thread indices within the block
    int tx = threadIdx.x % TL;
    int ty = threadIdx.x / TL;

    // Each thread computes a (j,l) position in the tile
    int j = tile_j + ty;
    int l = tile_l + tx;

    // Check if within bounds
    if (j >= M || l >= L) return;

    // Initialize the sum for this (j,l)
    float sum = 0.0f;

    // Loop over K in chunks of TK
    for (int k_block = 0; k_block < K; k_block += TK) {
        // Load the A and B tiles into shared memory
        __shared__ float shared_A[TM][TK];
        __shared__ float shared_B[TK][TL];

        // Compute the k index within the current block
        int k = k_block + threadIdx.x % TK; // Wait, need to distribute the load
        // Wait, perhaps better to have each thread load a part of A and B.

        // For A: each thread in the block (TM*TL threads) can help load the A tile.
        // The A tile is TM rows x TK columns. Each thread can load a row and column.

        // The thread's position in the A tile:
        int a_row = ty; // since ty is from 0 to TM-1
        int a_col = threadIdx.x % TK; // but need to see how to distribute.

        // Wait, maybe better to split the threads into two parts for A and B.

        // Alternatively, since the block has TM*TL threads, which may be less than TK*TM or TK*TL, perhaps need to use more threads.

        Hmm, this part is getting a bit tricky. Let me think again.

        The shared memory for A is TM rows x TK columns. Each thread in the block can be assigned to load a part of this. Since there are TM*TL threads, but the A tile has TM*TK elements, so each thread can load (TK / (TM*TL)) elements? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the block size should be larger to cover the A and B tiles.

        Alternatively, the block size is set to TK*TM for A and TK*TL for B, but that might not fit. Maybe the block size should be TK*TM + TK*TL, but that could be too big.

        Alternatively, the block size is set to TM * TK threads, but that might not be efficient.

        Maybe I need to restructure the block size. Let me think of the standard approach where the block size is TM * TK for the A tile and TK * TL for the B tile. But since we need to load both into shared memory, perhaps the block size is TM * TK + TK * TL, but that might be too big.

        Alternatively, the block size is set to TK threads, but that may not be enough.

        Hmm, perhaps I should use a block size of TM * TK for the A tile and TK * TL for the B tile, but that requires two separate shared memory allocations. Wait, but in the same block, we need to load both A and B tiles. So the block size must be sufficient to cover both.

        Let me think of the following approach:

        The block size is TM * TK threads. Each thread is responsible for loading a part of the A tile and a part of the B tile. But this might not be efficient.

        Alternatively, the block size is TM * TK for the A tile, and another block for the B tile, but that's not possible in a single kernel.

        Maybe I need to split the work between two phases: first load A into shared memory, then load B, then compute the partial sums.

        Let me try to structure the code as follows:

        For each k_block in 0 to K step TK:

            // Load A tile into shared memory
            // The A tile is for rows j in [tile_j ... tile_j + TM-1], columns k_block to k_block + TK-1
            // Each thread in the block can load a part of the A tile.

            // The A tile has TM rows and TK columns. Each thread can load a row and column.

            // The thread's index in the block is threadIdx.x. Since the block has TM*TL threads, but the A tile has TM*TK elements, perhaps we need to have more threads.

            Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should use a different approach where the block size is TM * TK for the A tile and TK * TL for the B tile, but that might not fit.

            Alternatively, perhaps the block size is set to TK threads, and each thread handles a column of the A and B tiles. But I'm not sure.

            Maybe I should look for a standard matrix multiplication kernel and adapt it here.

            Let me recall the standard tiled matrix multiplication kernel from CUDA samples.

            In the standard case, for C = A * B, where A is MxK, B is KxN, the kernel is structured with a block size of (TM, TN), and each block computes a TMxTN tile of C. The shared memory holds TMxTK and TKxTN tiles of A and B.

            The block size is typically TM * TN threads, but in some cases, it's TM * TK for A and TK * TN for B, but that requires more threads.

            Wait, perhaps the block size is TM + TK threads? No, that's not right.

            Let me think of the standard approach:

            The block size is TM * TN threads. Each thread in the block is responsible for a (row, col) in the TMxTN tile. The shared memory for A is TM rows x TK columns, and for B is TK columns x TN columns. Each thread loads a part of A and B into shared memory.

            For example, each thread in the block can load a row of A and a column of B. But the exact distribution depends on the block size.

            Alternatively, the block size is TM * TK threads for loading A, and then another set for B. But this is getting too involved.

            Maybe I should proceed with a simpler approach, even if it's not the most optimized, but at least functional.

            Let me try a simpler approach where each thread computes a single (i,j,l) triplet and loops over K. But given that K is 2048, this would be very slow. However, since the problem requires a hand-written kernel, perhaps this is the only way.

            Wait, but with N=16, M=1024, L=768, and K=2048, the total number of operations is N*M*L*K = 16 * 1024 * 768 * 2048. That's way too big. So a naive approach won't work.

            Therefore, I must use a tiled approach with shared memory.

            Let me try to proceed step by step.

            Let me set TM=16, TL=16, TK=32.

            The block size will be TM * TL threads (16x16=256 threads per block).

            Each block is responsible for a tile of TM rows and TL columns in the output matrix for a specific batch.

            The steps for the kernel:

            1. Determine the batch, tile_j, and tile_l.

            2. Each thread in the block computes its (j,l) position within the tile.

            3. For each k_block in 0 to K step TK:

                a. Load the A tile (TM rows x TK columns) into shared memory.

                b. Load the B tile (TK columns x TL columns) into shared memory.

                c. Synchronize threads.

                d. Compute the partial sum for the (j,l) position using the current tiles.

            4. After all k_blocks, write the sum to the output.

            Now, the shared memory allocation:

            We need two shared arrays: shared_A[ TM ][ TK ] and shared_B[ TK ][ TL ].

            The total size is (TM * TK + TK * TL) * 4 bytes. For TM=16, TK=32, TL=16:

            16*32 = 512, 32*16=512 → total 1024 floats → 4KB. That's acceptable.

            Now, the code:

            First, in the kernel:

            __global__ void batched_matmul_kernel(
                const float* __restrict__ A,
                const float* __restrict__ B,
                float* __restrict__ C,
                int N, int M, int K, int L,
                int lda, int ldb, int ldc) {

                // Constants for tile dimensions
                const int TM = 16;
                const int TL = 16;
                const int TK = 32;

                // Determine batch and tile indices
                int batch = blockIdx.x / ( ((M + TM-1)/TM) * ((L + TL-1)/TL) );
                int tile_idx = blockIdx.x % ( ((M + TM-1)/TM) * ((L + TL-1)/TL) );

                int tile_j = (tile_idx / ((L + TL-1)/TL)) ) * TM;
                int tile_l = (tile_idx % ((L + TL-1)/TL)) ) * TL;

                // Thread indices within the block
                int tx = threadIdx.x % TL;
                int ty = threadIdx.x / TL;

                // Compute j and l within the tile
                int j = tile_j + ty;
                int l = tile_l + tx;

                // Check if within bounds
                if (j >= M || l >= L) return;

                // Initialize sum
                float sum = 0.0f;

                // Loop over K in chunks of TK
                for (int k_block = 0; k_block < K; k_block += TK) {
                    // Load A and B tiles into shared memory

                    // Shared memory declarations
                    __shared__ float shared_A[TM][TK];
                    __shared__ float shared_B[TK][TL];

                    // Compute the indices for A and B tiles
                    int a_row = ty; // since ty is from 0 to TM-1
                    int a_col = k_block + threadIdx.x % TK; // Wait, this may not be correct.

                    Wait, perhaps the A tile is loaded by the threads in the block. Each thread in the block can load a part of the A and B tiles.

                    For the A tile (TM rows x TK columns):

                    Each thread in the block can be assigned to load a row of A and a column of B.

                    Wait, perhaps the A tile is loaded by the threads as follows:

                    The A tile has TM rows (from tile_j to tile_j + TM-1) and TK columns (k_block to k_block + TK-1).

                    Each thread in the block can be assigned to load a row of the A tile and a column of the B tile.

                    For example, for the A tile:

                    The thread's index in the block is threadIdx.x. Since the block has TM * TL threads, but the A tile has TM * TK elements, we need to distribute the load.

                    Alternatively, each thread can load a row of A and a column of B.

                    Let me think of the A tile:

                    The A tile has TM rows (each row corresponds to a row in the output tile's row) and TK columns (current k_block to k_block + TK-1).

                    Each thread in the block can be assigned to a row and a column in the A tile.

                    The number of elements in the A tile is TM * TK. The block has TM * TL threads. Since TK may be larger than TL, this may not be sufficient. For example, with TM=16, TK=32, TL=16 → TM*TL=256 threads, but A tile has 16*32=512 elements. So each thread would need to load two elements.

                    Hmm, that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the block size should be TM * TK threads, but that would be 16*32=512 threads, which is allowed (max threads per block is 1024).

                    Alternatively, let's adjust the block size to TM * TK threads. Let me see:

                    Let's set the block size to TM * TK threads (16 * 32 = 512 threads). Then, each thread can be assigned to a row and column in the A tile.

                    So for the A tile:

                    Each thread's index is threadIdx.x. The row in the A tile is ty = threadIdx.x / TK → since TM=16, this would give 0-15 rows. The column in the A tile is tx = threadIdx.x % TK → 0-31 columns.

                    Then, the element in the A tile is at (ty, tx).

                    The corresponding global A element is:

                    A's batch is batch.

                    The row in A is j_row = tile_j + ty.

                    The column in A is k = k_block + tx.

                    So the global index in A is:

                    A_index = batch * lda + (j_row * K) + k;

                    Similarly for B:

                    The B tile is TK columns (k_block to k_block + TK-1) and TL columns (the tile_l to tile_l + TL-1).

                    Each thread in the block can also load a part of the B tile. The B tile has TK rows and TL columns. So each thread can be assigned to a row and column in the B tile.

                    For example, the thread's index is threadIdx.x. The row in B is k_row = k_block + (threadIdx.x / TL), and the column is l_col = tx % TL.

                    Wait, but the B tile is K rows (k_block to k_block+TK-1) and L columns (but we're only loading the current TL columns for the output tile's l).

                    The B tile's rows are from k_block to k_block + TK-1, and columns are from l_col in the output tile's l.

                    Wait, the B tile's columns are the current tile's l range. The B's columns are l in the output's l, so the B tile's columns are tile_l to tile_l + TL-1.

                    So for the B tile:

                    The B element at (k, l) in the B matrix (since B is KxL) is B[k][l], which is stored at B + k*L + l.

                    The B tile's rows are k_block to k_block + TK-1, and columns are tile_l to tile_l + TL-1.

                    So each thread in the block can be assigned to a row and column in the B tile:

                    The row in B is k = k_block + (threadIdx.x / TL)

                    The column in B is l = tile_l + (threadIdx.x % TL)

                    Wait, but the B tile has TK rows and TL columns. So the total elements are TK * TL. Since the block has TM*TK threads (512), and TK*TL = 32*16=512, so each thread can handle one element.

                    So for the B tile:

                    The thread's index is threadIdx.x. The row in B is k = k_block + (threadIdx.x / TL)

                    The column in B is l = tile_l + (threadIdx.x % TL)

                    The global index in B is B + k*L + l.

                    So putting this together:

                    For each k_block:

                        // Load A tile into shared_A
                        int a_row = ty = threadIdx.x / TK; // Wait, no, need to re-express.

                        Wait, let me re-structure the block size and thread indices.

                        Let me set the block size to TM * TK threads for A and TK * TL threads for B. But that's not possible in a single block. Hmm, perhaps I need to have two separate loops for loading A and B.

                        Alternatively, the block size is TM * TK threads. Each thread can load an element of A and an element of B.

                        Wait, let's try this approach:

                        The block has TM * TK threads (16*32=512).

                        For the A tile:

                        Each thread is responsible for one element in the A tile:

                        a_row = ty = threadIdx.x / TK → 0 to TM-1 (since threadIdx.x can go up to 511, 511/32=15.9375 → 15)

                        a_col = tx = threadIdx.x % TK → 0 to TK-1

                        So the A element is at (tile_j + a_row, k_block + a_col).

                        The global index in A is:

                        A_offset = batch * lda + ( (tile_j + a_row) * K ) + (k_block + a_col);

                        shared_A[a_row][a_col] = A[A_offset];

                        Then, for the B tile:

                        The B tile has TK rows (k_block to k_block+TK-1) and TL columns (tile_l to tile_l + TL-1).

                        Each thread can also load a part of the B tile. Since the B tile has TK*TL elements (32*16=512), and the block has 512 threads, each thread can load one element.

                        The thread's index is threadIdx.x.

                        The row in B is k = k_block + (threadIdx.x / TL)

                        The column in B is l = tile_l + (threadIdx.x % TL)

                        The global index in B is B_offset = (k)*L + l;

                        shared_B[k - k_block][ l - tile_l ] = B[B_offset];

                        Wait, the B tile is stored in shared_B[0..TK-1][0..TL-1], so the row in shared_B is (k - k_block), and column is (l - tile_l).

                        So:

                        shared_B[ (threadIdx.x / TL) ][ (threadIdx.x % TL) ] = B[B_offset];

                        Wait, no. Let me see:

                        For the B tile's row in shared memory is (k - k_block), which is (k_block + (threadIdx.x / TL) - k_block) = threadIdx.x / TL.

                        The column in shared_B is (l - tile_l) = (tile_l + (threadIdx.x % TL) - tile_l) = threadIdx.x % TL.

                        So yes, that's correct.

                        So after loading both tiles into shared memory, we need to synchronize.

                        Then, each thread computes its (j,l) in the output tile.

                        The thread's (j,l) in the output is:

                        j = tile_j + ty (where ty is threadIdx.x / TK → but wait, in this block size setup, the thread's threadIdx.x is up to 511, so ty = threadIdx.x / TK → 511/32=15.9375 → 15, which is within TM=16.

                        Wait, but the output tile's j and l are tile_j + ty and tile_l + tx, where ty and tx are derived from the thread's position in the block.

                        Wait, perhaps the thread's responsibility for the output (j,l) is determined by their position in the block's tile.

                        The output tile has TM rows and TL columns. Each thread in the block (which has TM*TK threads) can't directly map to the output's (j,l). Hmm, this is getting confusing.

                        Maybe I need to separate the loading and computation steps.

                        After loading the A and B tiles into shared memory, each thread in the block can compute the contribution of the current k_block to their (j,l) in the output.

                        The (j,l) in the output is tile_j + ty and tile_l + tx, where ty and tx are derived from the thread's position in the block.

                        Wait, perhaps the thread's responsibility for the output (j,l) is:

                        The block has TM rows (tile_j to tile_j + TM-1) and TL columns (tile_l to tile_l + TL-1). Each thread in the block is responsible for a (ty, tx) position in this tile, where ty ranges from 0 to TM-1 and tx from 0 to TL-1.

                        So the thread's index in the block for this purpose is (ty, tx), which can be computed as:

                        ty = threadIdx.x / TL;

                        tx = threadIdx.x % TL;

                        Wait, but the block has TM*TK threads, which is more than TM*TL. So this approach won't work.

                        Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Perhaps I should use a different block size.

                        Let me try to set the block size to TM * TL threads (16x16=256). This way, each thread can be assigned to a (ty, tx) in the output tile (TM rows and TL columns).

                        Then, for loading the A and B tiles:

                        The A tile has TM rows and TK columns. To load this into shared memory, each thread in the block can load a row of A and a column of B.

                        For the A tile:

                        Each thread can load a row of A (ty) and a column of A (k_col). Since the block has TM*TL threads, but the A tile has TM*TK elements, each thread would need to load multiple elements. Alternatively, we can use multiple threads per element.

                        Alternatively, use a loop over the TK columns in the A tile.

                        Let me think of the following:

                        For the A tile:

                        The A tile is TM rows (tile_j to tile_j+TM-1) and TK columns (k_block to k_block+TK-1).

                        Each thread in the block (TM*TL threads) can load a row of A (ty) and a column of A (k_col). But since there are only TM rows, each thread can load a row and a column.

                        Wait, perhaps the threads can be divided into groups for loading A and B.

                        Alternatively, use a loop over the columns of the A tile.

                        For example, each thread in the block can load a row of A and a column of B for each k in the current k_block.

                        This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

                        Let me try to write the kernel code step by step, even if it's not perfect.

                        Here's an outline:

                        __global__ void batched_matmul_kernel(
                            const float* __restrict__ A,
                            const float* __restrict__ B,
                            float* __restrict__ C,
                            int N, int M, int K, int L,
                            int lda, int ldb, int ldc) {

                            const int TM = 16;
                            const int TL = 16;
                            const int TK = 32;

                            // Determine batch and tile indices
                            int batch = blockIdx.x / ( ((M + TM-1)/TM) * ((L + TL-1)/TL) );
                            int tile_idx = blockIdx.x % ( ((M + TM-1)/TM) * ((L + TL-1)/TL) );

                            int tile_j = (tile_idx / ((L + TL-1)/TL)) ) * TM;
                            int tile_l = (tile_idx % ((L + TL-1)/TL)) ) * TL;

                            // Thread indices within the block
                            int tx = threadIdx.x % TL;
                            int ty = threadIdx.x / TL;

                            // Compute j and l within the tile
                            int j = tile_j + ty;
                            int l = tile_l + tx;

                            // Check if within bounds
                            if (j >= M || l >= L) return;
