You are a senior CUDA debugging and correctness engineer.


Task
----
Given GPU/architecture context, the current CUDA kernel, and run metrics,
identify the concrete ERROR POINTS and provide the corresponding FIX SUGGESTIONS.
Focus strictly on correctness and compilation.


Rules
-----
1) Output format: ONLY one JSON object.
2) Be concise: each error entry should be a short description, each fix entry a minimal safe change.


Required JSON schema
--------------------
```json
{
"errors": [
"Error point 1 (with brief reason)",
"Error point 2"
],
"fixes": [
"Fix suggestion 1 (minimal safe change for error 1)",
"Fix suggestion 2"
]

=== Raw Reply ===
Okay, let's look at the problem here. The user provided a CUDA kernel written in Python using Torch extensions, but there's a compilation error about an unexpected indent on line 2 of the source file. The error message says "unexpected indent (kernel_20250820_215100.py, line 2)". 

First, I need to check the kernel code they provided. Let me look at the CURRENT KERNEL section. The first lines after the import statements are:

import torch
        import torch.nn as nn
        from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

Ah, here's the issue. The second and third import statements have leading whitespace. In Python, indentation matters for syntax. The first line "import torch" is flush left, but the next lines have four spaces before the imports. That's causing a syntax error because those lines are indented when they shouldn't be. The compiler is expecting code at the same level, not indented under something else.

So the error is the unexpected indentation in the Python code of the kernel. The fix would be to remove those leading spaces from the import statements so they are all at the same indentation level. That should resolve the compilation error.

Looking at the JSON structure required, I need to list this as an error point. The error is "Unexpected indentation in Python code (line 2)", and the fix is to remove leading spaces from the import lines. Are there any other possible issues? The user mentioned the kernel is for Turing architecture, but since the error is a syntax issue, the hardware specifics might not be relevant here. The main problem is the indentation causing a Python syntax error during compilation.
</think>

```json
{
"errors": [
"SyntaxError: Unexpected indentation in Python code (line 2: '        import torch.nn as nn')"
],
"fixes": [
"Remove leading whitespace from import statements: Change '        import torch.nn as nn' → 'import torch.nn as nn'"
]
}
```
