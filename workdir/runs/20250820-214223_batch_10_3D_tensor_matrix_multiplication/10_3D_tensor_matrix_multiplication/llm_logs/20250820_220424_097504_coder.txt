3. Inside the block, follow **exactly** this order:
   1. Imports – `torch`, `torch.nn`, `load_inline`.
   2. `source` – triple‑quoted CUDA string(s) (kernel + host wrapper).
   3. `cpp_src` – prototypes for *all* kernels you expose.
   4. **One** `load_inline` call per kernel group.
   5. `class ModelNew(nn.Module)` – mirrors original inputs/outputs but calls
      your CUDA kernels.

=== Raw Reply ===
Okay, let's see. The user provided a CUDA kernel that's causing a compiler error because it's using at::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream(), which doesn't exist. The error message says that the namespace 'at::cuda' has no member 'getCurrentCUDAStream'. Hmm, right, I remember that in PyTorch, the way to get the current CUDA stream might have changed. 

Wait, maybe the correct function is at::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream(A) or something like that? Or perhaps it's now part of the Tensor's properties. Let me think. Oh right, the getCurrentCUDAStream function might require a device argument, or maybe it's moved to another namespace. Alternatively, maybe it's torch::cuda::current_stream() now?

Looking up in my mind, the current_stream() is a common way. For example, in TorchScript or CUDA extensions, to get the current stream, you might use torch::cuda::current_stream(). The at::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream might be deprecated or incorrect. So the line in the kernel launch that's causing the error is passing at::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream(), which is wrong.

So the fix is to replace that with the correct stream retrieval. The correct syntax would probably be torch::cuda::current_stream().cuda_stream(). Or maybe just torch::cuda::current_stream(). Because the kernel launch requires a cudaStream_t. Let me recall the exact API. The current_stream() returns a torch::cuda::Stream, and to get the underlying cudaStream_t, you might need to call .stream() on it. Wait, the torch::cuda::current_stream() returns a Stream object, and to get the cudaStream_t, you can use .stream().

Alternatively, maybe the function torch::cuda::current_stream().get() gives the cudaStream_t. Let me think. The code in the kernel launch is passing at::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream(), which is wrong. So replacing that with torch::cuda::current_stream().stream() would be the right approach. Or perhaps the function is torch::cuda::getCurrentStream()? Wait, maybe the correct function is torch::cuda::getCurrentStream()? Or maybe it's torch::cuda::current_stream().

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use at::current_stream(). The at namespace might have the function. Let me think of the correct syntax. For example, in some PyTorch extensions, you might see something like at::cuda::getCurrentStream(). But the error says that at::cuda doesn't have that member. So maybe the correct path is torch::cuda::current_stream().

Wait, perhaps the correct code is:

auto stream = at::cuda::current_stream();
Or maybe torch::cuda::current_stream().stream().

Alternatively, maybe the function is at::current_stream(c10::DeviceIndex device). Since the tensors A and B are on a device, perhaps we can get the device from A. So, for example:

auto stream = at::cuda::current_stream(A.device().index());

But the exact syntax might vary. Let me think of the correct way. The error is in the line where the kernel is launched. The problematic line is:

matmul3d_kernel<<<blocks, threads, shared_mem, at::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream()>>>(...

So replacing at::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream() with the correct stream. Let me check the PyTorch documentation. Oh right, in recent versions, the way to get the current stream is using torch::cuda::current_stream(). But to get the cudaStream_t, you might need to call .stream() on that. So the correct parameter would be torch::cuda::current_stream().stream().

Alternatively, maybe the function is at::cuda::getCurrentStream(). But the error indicates that 'getCurrentCUDAStream' is not present. So perhaps the correct function is called getCurrentStream without the 'CUDA' part. Let me see. For example, in some code examples, they use at::cuda::getCurrentStream(). But maybe the correct function is torch::cuda::current_stream().stream().

Alternatively, perhaps the correct code is:

at::cuda::getCurrentStream() might have been renamed to at::cuda::current_stream(). So changing getCurrentCUDAStream to current_stream().

Wait, perhaps the correct function is at::cuda::getCurrentStream(), but the user wrote getCurrentCUDAStream. So the typo is CUDA in the name. Let me check. The error message says the member is 'getCurrentCUDAStream', which the compiler can't find. So maybe the correct function is called getCurrentStream, without the CUDA in the name. So changing that would fix the error.

So the line should be at::cuda::getCurrentStream() instead of getCurrentCUDAStream. Let me see. Let me think of the actual API. For example, in PyTorch's headers, the function might be named getCurrentStream. So the user made a typo in the function name. That's probably the issue here.

Therefore, the fix is to replace at::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream() with at::cuda::getCurrentStream(). Or perhaps torch::cuda::current_stream().stream().

Alternatively, maybe the correct function is at::current_stream().stream(). Let me think again. Suppose the correct code is:

auto stream = at::cuda::current_stream(A.device().index());

Then passing stream.stream() as the stream parameter. But perhaps the simplest fix is to correct the function name from getCurrentCUDAStream to getCurrentStream.

Alternatively, maybe the function is in the torch:: namespace. Let me think of possible code examples. For instance, in some CUDA extensions, the stream is obtained via:

auto stream = at::cuda::current_stream();

But perhaps the getCurrentStream is the old name. Alternatively, perhaps the correct function is torch::cuda::current_stream().stream().

Alternatively, maybe the user should use the device of the tensor. For example:

auto stream = at::cuda::getCurrentStream(A.device().type() == at::kCUDA ? A.device().index() : -1);

But that might complicate things. The minimal fix is to correct the function name. Since the error is about 'getCurrentCUDAStream' not existing, perhaps the correct function is called 'getCurrentStream' without the CUDA in the name. So changing that would fix the error.

So in the kernel launch line, replace at::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream() with at::cuda::getCurrentStream().

Alternatively, maybe the function is in the torch::cuda namespace. Let me see. Suppose the correct code is torch::cuda::getCurrentStream(). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the function is torch::cuda::current_stream().stream().

Alternatively, maybe the correct way is to use torch::cuda::current_stream().stream().

Wait, let's think of the exact syntax. The kernel launch requires a cudaStream_t. The current_stream() function in torch::cuda returns a torch::cuda::Stream object, which has a method stream() that returns the cudaStream_t. So the correct code would be:

torch::cuda::current_stream().stream()

Therefore, the line should be:

matmul3d_kernel<<<blocks, threads, shared_mem, torch::cuda::current_stream().stream()>>>(...

Alternatively, maybe the user should use at::cuda::current_stream().stream(). But I'm not entirely sure about the exact namespace. However, given the error message, the original code uses at::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream, which is incorrect. The correct function is likely in torch::cuda, and the correct name is current_stream().

Therefore, replacing that part should fix the compiler error. Let me adjust the code accordingly.

So the corrected line in the kernel launch would be:

matmul3d_kernel<<<blocks, threads, shared_mem, torch::cuda::current_stream().stream()>>>(...

Alternatively, if the function is in the at namespace, perhaps:

at::cuda::current_stream().stream()

But I think torch::cuda is more likely. Let me proceed with that.

Therefore, the minimal fix is to change the stream parameter from at::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream() to torch::cuda::current_stream().stream().

Alternatively, maybe the function is at::current_stream().stream(). But I think torch::cuda is the right path here.

So applying that change should resolve the compiler error. Let me make sure there are no other issues. The rest of the code seems okay. The shared memory calculation, kernel parameters, etc., are as per the original code. The problem is solely the stream retrieval.

Thus, the repaired code should have that line corrected.
