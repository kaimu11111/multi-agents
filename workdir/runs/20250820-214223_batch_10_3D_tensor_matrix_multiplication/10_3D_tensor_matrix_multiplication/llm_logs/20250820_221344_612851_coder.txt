2. The block must be directly runnable:
       python model_new.py
3. Inside the block, follow **exactly** this order:
   1. Imports – `torch`, `torch.nn`, `load_inline`.
   2. `source` – triple‑quoted CUDA string(s) (kernel + host wrapper).
   3. `cpp_src` – prototypes for *all* kernels you expose.
   4. **One** `load_inline` call per kernel group.
   5. `class ModelNew(nn.Module)` – mirrors original inputs/outputs but calls
      your CUDA kernels.
4. **Do NOT include** testing code, `if __name__ == "__main__"`, or extra prose.

=== Raw Reply ===
Okay, let's see. The user provided a CUDA kernel that's not compiling because of errors related to torch::cuda::current_stream(). The error messages mention that current_stream() either doesn't exist in the namespace or that accessing .stream() is invalid.

First, I need to recall how to get the current CUDA stream in PyTorch. The error says that torch::cuda::current_stream() might not be the right function. Wait, maybe the correct function is just current_stream() without the cuda namespace? Or perhaps it's part of the device context?

Looking up, I remember that in TorchScript or the C++ extensions, the current stream can be obtained via torch::cuda::current_stream() which returns a torch::cuda::Stream object. But the error mentions that the method chain is invalid, like someone was trying to call .stream() on it. Oh, the original code has torch::cuda::current_stream().stream(), which is wrong. Because current_stream() already returns the stream, so adding .stream() would be trying to call a non-existent method. So the first fix is to remove the .stream() part.

Another error in the JSON says that torch::cuda::current_stream() doesn't exist. Wait, maybe the correct namespace is different? Maybe it's torch::cuda::current_stream(device), but perhaps the function is in the torch::cuda namespace. Alternatively, maybe the function is part of the torch::cuda::Stream class? Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to use torch::current_stream() instead of torch::cuda::current_stream()? Let me think. In PyTorch's C++ API, the function torch::cuda::current_stream() does exist. But maybe in some versions, the API changed. The error message says the namespace doesn't have that member, so maybe the correct function is torch::current_stream()?

Alternatively, perhaps the user's code is using an older version where the function is in a different namespace. Wait, the error message shows that the compiler can't find torch::cuda::current_stream. So the fix is to replace torch::cuda::current_stream().stream() with just torch::cuda::current_stream(), because the original code had an extra .stream() which is wrong. Wait, the first error says that current_stream() returns a stream object directly, so accessing .stream() is invalid. So the problem is the .stream() at the end. So the line should be torch::cuda::current_stream() instead of .stream().

So in the kernel launch, the 4th argument (stream) should be torch::cuda::current_stream(), not with the extra .stream().

Wait, looking at the code in the question's current kernel:

matmul3d_kernel<<<blocks, threads, shared_mem, torch::cuda::current_stream().stream()>>>(...

So the user's code is calling current_stream(), then calling .stream() on the result. That's wrong. The correct is to just pass torch::cuda::current_stream() as the stream. So removing the .stream() part.

So the first fix is to change that line to use torch::cuda::current_stream() without the .stream().

But the error messages also mention that torch::cuda::current_stream() doesn't exist. Wait, maybe the correct function is in the torch namespace? Like torch::current_stream()? Let me check the PyTorch C++ API docs.

Looking it up: The function torch::cuda::current_stream() is indeed the correct way to get the current stream for the current device. So the error message's first point says that the user's code has torch::cuda::current_stream().stream(), which is wrong because current_stream returns a Stream object, so adding .stream() is invalid. The second error says that torch::cuda::current_stream() doesn't exist. Wait, that's conflicting. The error message in the JSON says "torch::cuda::current_stream() - function does not exist in torch::cuda namespace (compilation error)".

Hmm, that suggests that the function isn't found. Maybe the correct function is torch::current_stream()? Let me think again. Maybe in some versions, the API changed. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using an older PyTorch version where the function is in a different namespace. Alternatively, maybe the correct syntax is torch::cuda::current_stream(0) to specify the device, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use torch::cuda::getCurrentStream()? Maybe the function name changed. Wait, in older versions, perhaps it was getCurrentStream? Let me think. The current_stream() is the modern name, but maybe in some versions, the function is named differently. Since the compilation error says that torch::cuda::current_stream() doesn't exist, perhaps the correct function is torch::cuda::current_stream() but the user's environment has an older PyTorch version where it's called differently. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the namespace.

Alternatively, maybe the correct function is torch::current_stream()? Let me check the C++ API. For example, in the torch/csrc/api/include/torch/extension.h, the function torch::current_stream() is available, which returns the current stream for the current device. So perhaps the correct code should use torch::current_stream() instead of torch::cuda::current_stream().

So if the error says that torch::cuda::current_stream() doesn't exist, then changing it to torch::current_stream() would fix that. Because the user's code uses torch::cuda::current_stream().stream(), which is wrong in two ways: the function might not be in the cuda namespace, and the .stream() is redundant.

So combining both fixes: the line should be torch::current_stream(), without the .stream() and without the cuda namespace.

Therefore, the corrected kernel launch line would be:

matmul3d_kernel<<<blocks, threads, shared_mem, torch::current_stream()>>>(...

That should address both errors: removing the .stream() and using the correct function in the torch namespace instead of cuda.

So the steps are:

1. In the kernel launch, replace torch::cuda::current_stream().stream() with torch::current_stream().

That should fix the compilation errors mentioned.

Now, checking the other parts of the code. The rest seems okay. The kernel parameters and the rest of the code structure should be fine. The shared memory allocation and the kernel logic might have other issues, but the user specified to make minimal changes for compilation and correctness, not performance.

Therefore, the only change needed is in the kernel launch's stream parameter.
