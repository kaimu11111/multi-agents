=== Raw Reply ===
Okay, I need to come up with five strategies for the seed kernel based on the given context and GPU architecture. Let me start by reviewing the existing strategies to avoid duplicates.

The existing strategies already set the block dimensions (BLOCK_M=32, BLOCK_N=32, BLOCK_K=16), grid dimensions, shared memory layout, vectorized loads with float4, and alignment enforcement. So I should focus on other areas.

First, the GPU is a Quadro RTX 6000, which is based on Turing architecture (Compute Capability 7.5). Since the current strategies use float4 for vectorization (16B alignment), that's good. Maybe check if using float2 (8B) as a fallback for misaligned data could be useful? But the existing align strategy enforces 16B, so maybe not necessary.

Next, coalesced global memory access is important. The current setup uses row-major for shared memory, but how are the global loads structured? For matrix A (MxK), threads might load rows, and for B (KxN), columns. Ensuring coalesced accesses for both could be a strategy. So maybe [coalesce] for A and B accesses.

Then, double-buffering for the K dimension. The existing strategies don't mention it, so suggesting [double-buffer] with 2 stages for the K dimension might help overlap memory and computation.

Broadcasting might be applicable here. Since in matrix multiplication, rows of A and columns of B are reused across threads in a block. Maybe [broadcast] for loading rows of A and columns of B into shared memory to reduce bank conflicts?

Thread block layout: The current block is 32x32x16. The threads might be arranged in a way that each thread handles a small tile. Ensuring that each thread's work is balanced and that the warp execution is efficient. Maybe a [tiling] strategy to use a 2D thread arrangement (e.g., 16x16 threads) to cover the block's M and N dimensions.

Also, boundary handling. Since the matrices are 64x64 and the blocks are 32x32, there's no overflow here, but for general cases, using [guard] to handle cases where M or N aren't multiples of the block size. So adding a strategy for predication-based masking.

Wait, the existing grid strategy already calculates gridDim as (2,2) for 64, so maybe that's covered. But in the kernel code, when accessing global memory, threads might go out of bounds. So a guard strategy would help there.

Let me list possible strategies:

1. [coalesce] Ensure row-major loads for A and column-major for B to guarantee coalesced accesses. Since the existing shared memory is row-major, but global loads need to align with the memory layout.

2. [double-buffer] Implement double buffering for the K dimension with 2 stages to hide memory latency during the K iteration.

3. [broadcast] Use block broadcast for A and B tiles in shared memory to exploit reuse (maybe using shuffle or explicit broadcasts).

4. [occupancy] Unroll the K-loop by a factor of 2 to maintain high occupancy without excessive register usage (since unrolling can increase registers but improve IPC).

5. [guard] Apply predication to mask threads outside the matrix boundaries during global writes to C.

Wait, but the existing strategies already have a grid setup. Let me check again:

The existing strategies mention [coalesce] isn't listed, so that's a good point. Also, double buffering is new. The broadcast idea might be part of shared memory use, but maybe not explicitly. Occupancy is a good point because unrolling can help. The guard strategy for boundary handling is important.

Alternatively, another strategy could be aligning the output C's storage, but existing align covers inputs. Maybe the thread block layout uses a 2D arrangement. Wait, the block dimensions are BLOCK_M=32 and BLOCK_N=32, so a 2D block of 32x32 threads (assuming each thread handles 1x1 elements), which is standard. So perhaps the thread indices are arranged as tx = threadIdx.x, ty = threadIdx.y, so that the shared memory accesses are coalesced.

Alternatively, maybe using a tile size per thread that divides the block dimensions. For example, each thread handles 1x1 elements in the tile, so with 32x32 threads, the shared tiles can be fully utilized. Not sure if that's a separate strategy.

Hmm, maybe the first strategy should be about coalescing the global loads. Since A is row-major, each warp should load contiguous memory. Similarly, for B, if it's stored column-major, then loading columns might be coalesced. Wait, the problem says the input tensors are A (M,K) and B (K,N), stored in row-major. So B is stored as K rows of N elements each. So when loading a column of B (which is K elements), the threads would need to load non-contiguous data, leading to uncoalesced accesses unless transposed. So maybe a strategy to transpose B to row-major for easier coalescing? But that's probably beyond the kernel's control unless done in the kernel setup. Alternatively, reorganizing the thread indices for B's loads. Alternatively, suggest using column-major storage for B? Not sure. Maybe the coalesce strategy here would be to arrange thread indices such that global loads for A and B are coalesced.

Alternatively, [coalesce] for A: load full warp-striped vectors, and for B, load with column-based coalescing. Since B is column-major, each thread's column element might be spaced by N, but that's tricky. Maybe the shared memory approach handles that, but the initial global load needs to be coalesced. So perhaps the first strategy is:

[coalesce] Structure global loads for A in row-major and B in column-major to ensure coalesced accesses. For A, threads in a warp load contiguous elements. For B, use column-wise strides to align threads.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each block processes a tile of A (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and a tile of B (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N). The threads in a block would typically load their part of these tiles. So for A, each thread might load a element from A's row, leading to coalesced. For B, since it's a column, the threads might load from different rows, so unless they are arranged properly, it could be uncoalesced. So the coalescing strategy would need to handle that. Maybe using a transpose or adjusting the load pattern.

Alternatively, since the existing shared memory uses row-major, perhaps the global loads for B should be arranged to fit into that. Hmm, perhaps this is better expressed as a coalescing strategy.

Another thought: since the existing vectorization is using float4, the alignment is 16B. So for B's column-major storage, the column may not be aligned. So maybe a strategy to pad or adjust the loads? Not sure.

Alternatively, the [guard] strategy is to handle cases where the matrix dimensions aren't multiples of the block sizes, even though in this case M=N=64, which is divisible by 32. But the general case may need it, so the kernel should include boundary checks.

Putting this together, possible strategies:

1. [coalesce] Structure global memory loads for A using row-major order and B using column-major order to ensure coalesced accesses, minimizing memory transaction overhead.
   
2. [double-buffer] Implement double buffering for the K dimension using two stages to overlap memory transfers with computation during the tile accumulation loop.

3. [broadcast] Use block-level broadcast of A and B tiles in shared memory to reduce bank conflicts and increase reuse of loaded data across threads.

4. [occupancy] Unroll the K iteration loop by a factor of 2 to balance register usage and maintain high thread-block occupancy without excessive register pressure.

5. [guard] Apply predication to mask threads outside the matrix boundaries during global memory writes to the output C tensor, ensuring correct results without out-of-bounds accesses.

These strategies don't conflict with existing ones and cover coalescing, double buffering, broadcast, occupancy, and boundary handling. Let me check each for being atomic and within the seed stage's focus.

Yes, each is a distinct strategy, and they add to the existing ones. The Quadro RTX 6000's architecture (CC7.5) supports these features. Double buffering for K is common in matrix multiply kernels. Unrolling K by 2 keeps it manageable. The broadcast could refer to using shared memory efficiently. The guard is essential for correctness. Coalescing is crucial for memory efficiency.

I think these are valid strategies within the constraints.
