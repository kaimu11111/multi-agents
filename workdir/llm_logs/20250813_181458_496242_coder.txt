=== Raw Reply ===
Okay, I need to optimize the matrix multiplication in the given PyTorch model using CUDA kernels based on the provided strategies. Let me start by understanding the requirements and the target architecture.

The target GPU is a Quadro RTX 6000 with Turing architecture. It has 64KB shared memory per SM, max registers per thread is 255, and supports FP16 Tensor Cores but the task is for FP32 since the user mentioned not using TF32. The strategies include tiling, shared memory usage, vectorization, alignment, coalesced access, double buffering, and more.

First, the matrix multiplication is C = A (MxK) * B (KxN). The dimensions here are 64x64 for all, so M=N=K=64. The strategies mention using BLOCK_M=32, BLOCK_N=32, BLOCK_K=16. That divides 64 evenly, so each block handles 32x32 tiles for M and N, and 16 for K. The grid dimensions would be (ceil(64/32), ceil(64/32)) → (2,2), but since it's a 2D grid, maybe the kernel is launched with gridDim.x = ceil(M/BLOCK_M), gridDim.y = ceil(N/BLOCK_N). Wait, actually, in typical matrix multiplication kernels, the blocks are arranged in a grid where each block computes a tile of C. So the grid dimensions would be (ceil(M/BLOCK_M), ceil(N/BLOCK_N)), so for 64x64, that's (2,2). Each block handles a 32x32 tile of C.

The shared memory tiles for A and B should be row-major and column-major respectively, aligned to 16B. The vectorization strategy suggests using float4 (16B aligned) for global loads. So A is row-major, so each thread can load a float4 (4 elements) along the row. Similarly, B is column-major, so each thread might load a float4 along the column. But need to ensure alignment. The input tensors must be aligned to 16B, so the code should check and handle that, but the problem says to enforce alignment, so maybe the user ensures it, but the kernel should have a guard for misalignment? The example in the problem's reference code didn't handle misalignment, but the output rules say to handle boundary conditions and alignment safely. Hmm, perhaps the user's tensors are already aligned, but the kernel should have a fallback path if not. Alternatively, the problem says to enforce alignment, so maybe the code can assume that the inputs are aligned, but the kernel should check and use a scalar path if not. But that complicates things. The strategies mention "[align] Enforce 16B alignment for input tensor pointers to enable vectorized loads". So perhaps the kernel requires that the pointers are aligned, and if not, it can't proceed. But in practice, PyTorch tensors might not be aligned, so maybe the code should check and handle that. Alternatively, the user might have to ensure alignment, but the problem says to handle it in the code. Hmm, perhaps the code can have a check and use a scalar path if misaligned, but that's more complex. Maybe the problem expects that the inputs are properly aligned, so the code can proceed with vector loads assuming alignment. The user's input tensors are generated with torch.rand, which may not be aligned, so perhaps the code should handle that. Alternatively, the problem's strategies say to enforce alignment, so maybe the kernel requires it, and the code can assert that. But in practice, that might not be safe. Maybe the code can have a conditional to use vector loads only if aligned, else scalar. But that's getting complicated. Let me think of the example given in the reference: the element-wise add didn't handle alignment, so maybe the user expects that the inputs are properly aligned. Since the problem says to enforce alignment, perhaps the code can assume that the inputs are aligned, and the user is responsible for that. But in the code, perhaps the kernel can check the alignment and use a scalar path if not. Alternatively, the problem might just proceed with vector loads assuming alignment. Let me proceed with that, but include a note in the code that alignment is required, but the problem's strategies say to enforce it, so maybe the code can have a check. Hmm, perhaps the code can use __align__ in the kernel to ensure that the pointers are aligned. Alternatively, the problem's strategies mention to enforce alignment, so the code can use __assume_aligned in the CUDA code. Wait, in CUDA, you can use __ldg or __ldglobal with alignment, but perhaps the code can cast the pointers to aligned pointers. Alternatively, the code can use the __align__ attribute in the kernel. Alternatively, the problem's strategy says to enforce alignment, so the code can proceed with vector loads assuming that the pointers are aligned. Since the user is supposed to handle that, perhaps the code can proceed with that assumption. Let me proceed with that.

Next, the shared memory tiles. The strategy says to use row-major and column-major for A and B, respectively. So for A, each block's shared memory tile for A would be a row-major block of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K. Similarly, B's shared memory tile is column-major, so BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N. Wait, actually, in matrix multiplication, the tiles are often arranged so that each thread block computes a tile of C, and each thread in the block loads a part of A and B into shared memory. The typical approach is to have each block load a tile of A (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and a tile of B (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N) into shared memory. Then, each thread computes a part of the dot product. The shared memory tiles for A and B are stored in row-major and column-major to facilitate coalesced access when loading into shared memory.

The vectorization strategy says to use float4 for global loads. So for A, which is row-major, each thread can load a float4 (4 elements) along the row. Since the block is 32x32 threads, perhaps each thread is responsible for a 8x8 tile? Wait, the block dimensions might be 32x16 or something. Wait, the block dimensions for the kernel need to be determined. Let me think about the thread arrangement. The kernel is typically launched with a 2D block of threads, say, 32x16 or 16x16. Wait, the strategies mention using BLOCK_M=32, BLOCK_N=32, BLOCK_K=16. So the tile sizes are 32x32 for C, and 32x16 for A and 16x32 for B. The threads in the block need to handle the computation. Let me recall the standard matrix multiplication kernel structure.

In the standard tiled approach, each thread block computes a tile of C of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N. Each thread in the block is responsible for a small portion of this tile. The shared memory is used to store the tiles of A and B that are needed for the computation. The K dimension is processed in chunks of BLOCK_K. So for each iteration over K, the block loads a tile of A (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and a tile of B (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N) into shared memory. Then, each thread computes its part of the dot product using the shared memory tiles.

The thread block size is typically chosen to be a multiple of the warp size (32 threads). So for a 32x32 tile of C, the block might be 16x16 threads, so each thread handles a 2x2 element in the tile. Alternatively, the block could be 32x16, so each thread handles 1x1 elements. Wait, perhaps the block dimensions are 32x16, so that each thread handles a 1x1 element in the C tile, but with multiple iterations over K. Let me think: the total number of threads in the block must be sufficient to cover the tile. For a 32x32 tile, 32x32 threads would be too much (since the maximum threads per block is 1024, but the SM can handle that). Alternatively, using 16x16 threads, each thread handles 2x2 elements. But the exact arrangement depends on the kernel design.

Alternatively, the block is arranged as 32 threads in the M direction and 16 in N, so 32x16 threads. Each thread is responsible for a single element in the C tile, but with multiple threads per row. Hmm, perhaps the block dimensions are 16x16, so each thread handles a 2x2 area. Alternatively, the block is 32x8, so each thread handles a 1x4 area. This is getting a bit complex. Let me look at the strategies again. The strategies mention using shared memory tiles for A and B, and using shuffle instructions for broadcast. Also, the double buffering for K dimension with 2 stages. The occupancy strategy suggests unrolling the K loop by 2 to improve IPC while keeping registers under 48 per warp.

The shared memory tiles for A and B should be row-major and column-major. Let me structure the kernel as follows:

Each block computes a tile of C of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N (32x32). The block is divided into threads such that each thread handles a small portion of the tile. The shared memory for A is a tile of size (BLOCK_M + 1) x (BLOCK_K) to handle padding, and similarly for B. Wait, perhaps the shared memory for A is BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K, and for B is BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N. The total shared memory needed per block would be (BLOCK_M * BLOCK_K + BLOCK_K * BLOCK_N) * 4 bytes. With BLOCK_M=32, BLOCK_N=32, BLOCK_K=16, that's (32*16 + 16*32)*4 = (512 + 512)*4 = 4096 bytes, which is well under the 64KB limit. So that's okay.

The double buffering strategy suggests using two stages for the K dimension, so that while one stage is being processed, the next is being loaded into shared memory. This requires two shared memory tiles for A and B. So the shared memory would need to hold two copies of A and B tiles. Wait, but that might exceed the shared memory. Let me recalculate: with two stages, the shared memory would be (BLOCK_M * BLOCK_K + BLOCK_K * BLOCK_N) * 2. So (32*16 + 16*32)*2 *4 = (512 + 512)*2 *4 = 2048 *4 = 8192 bytes. Still under 64KB. So that's manageable.

The vectorization part: using float4 for global loads. For A, which is row-major, each thread can load a float4 (4 elements) along the row. Since the block is processing a tile of A of size 32x16 (for each K iteration), each thread might be responsible for a certain number of elements. Let me think of the thread indices. Suppose the block is 16x16 threads. Each thread in the block has indices (tx, ty). The tile of A is 32x16, so each thread can load a 2x1 block of A (since 32/16=2 rows per thread in x direction, and 16 columns divided by 16 threads in y direction gives 1 column per thread). Wait, perhaps the threads are arranged such that each thread handles a 2x1 block of A. So for A's global load, each thread loads a 2x1 block (2 elements along the row). But using float4 would require 4 elements. Hmm, maybe the block is arranged as 8x8 threads, so each thread handles 4 elements in the row. Alternatively, perhaps the block is 32x8 threads, so each thread can handle a 1x2 block. This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of the standard approach.

In the standard tiled matrix multiply, each thread might load a portion of A and B into shared memory. For example, in a block of 16x16 threads, each thread could be responsible for a 2x2 portion of the C tile. The shared memory tiles for A and B would be loaded in such a way that each thread loads a few elements from global memory into shared memory. The vectorization would come into play when loading those elements. For instance, if the data is aligned, a thread can load a float4 (4 elements) at a time, which is 16B aligned. So for A, which is row-major, each thread could load a 4-element chunk along the row. The key is to ensure that the global memory accesses are coalesced and aligned.

The coalescing strategy requires that A's accesses are row-major (so contiguous) and B's are column-major (so contiguous in column-major storage). Since B is stored in column-major (as per the problem's input: B is KxN, and in PyTorch, tensors are stored in row-major, but the input B is K rows, N columns. Wait, actually, in PyTorch, tensors are stored in row-major order. So a matrix B with shape (K, N) is stored as row-major, so each row is K elements. Wait, but the problem says B is column-major? Wait, the strategy says "coalesce] Structure global loads for A (row-major) and B (column-major)". Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me recheck the strategy: the user's strategy says "coalesce] Structure global loads for A (row-major) and B (column-major) to guarantee warp-coalesced memory access patterns". So B is treated as column-major. That suggests that B is stored in column-major order, but in PyTorch, it's row-major. Hmm, this might be a problem. Wait, perhaps the kernel is designed to treat B as column-major, so when accessing B's elements, the indices are transposed. For example, if B is stored in row-major, then to access it as column-major, the code would have to transpose the indices. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to load B in a way that treats it as column-major, so that the global memory accesses are coalesced for column-major storage. Wait, but the actual storage is row-major. So perhaps the kernel is designed to load B in a way that the threads access columns of B, so that their accesses are contiguous in memory. Let me think: for B stored in row-major, a column is non-contiguous. So to access columns, the threads would need to jump over rows. That would not be coalesced. So perhaps the strategy is incorrect, or maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the B matrix is transposed in the kernel. Wait, the problem's task says to replace the PyTorch matmul operator, which is A (MxK) * B (KxN). The standard matrix multiplication requires that B is KxN, so when stored in row-major, each row is a K-element row. To multiply A (row-major) with B (row-major), the kernel would need to access B's columns, which are non-contiguous. To make the accesses coalesced for B, perhaps the kernel is designed to load B's columns as rows, by transposing the indices. For example, when accessing B's element at (k, n), the code would treat it as B[n][k], but that would require a transpose. Alternatively, the kernel could load B's columns in a way that the threads access contiguous memory. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The strategy says that B is column-major, so the kernel should structure B's loads as column-major. That implies that B is stored in column-major order, but in PyTorch, it's row-major. Therefore, perhaps the kernel is designed to treat B as column-major by accessing it in a way that the columns are contiguous. To do that, the kernel would have to load B's elements in a way that the threads access columns. For example, for a column-major B, the first element is B[0][0], then B[1][0], etc. So when stored in row-major, this would be non-contiguous. Therefore, the kernel would have to load B's elements in a way that the threads access columns, but that would not be coalesced unless the data is stored in column-major. Therefore, perhaps the strategy is suggesting that the kernel treats B as column-major, but the actual storage is row-major, so the accesses would not be coalesced. This is a problem. Maybe there's a mistake in the strategy description. Alternatively, perhaps the B matrix is transposed in the kernel. Wait, the problem says to replace the matmul operator, which is A * B. The standard matmul is C[i,j] = sum_k A[i,k] * B[k,j]. So for B, the rows are the K dimension and columns are N. To access B[k,j], in row-major storage, the elements are stored as B[k][0], B[k][1], ..., B[k][N-1]. So to get B[k,j], it's stored at position k*N + j. To access B's columns (varying j first), the accesses would be non-contiguous. Therefore, to have coalesced access for B's columns, the kernel would need to load B in a way that the threads access columns. But that would require that the threads' accesses are contiguous in memory, which would only happen if B is stored in column-major. Since it's not, perhaps the strategy is incorrect, or maybe the kernel uses a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the kernel uses a tiled approach where each thread block loads a tile of B into shared memory in a column-major layout, so that when accessed from shared memory, it's contiguous. That way, the global loads can be coalesced by loading the rows of B (since they are contiguous in global memory) into the shared memory in a column-major way. Hmm, that might be the case. Let me think of the steps:

1. The block loads a tile of A (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) from global memory into shared memory. Since A is row-major, the accesses are contiguous, so each thread can load a chunk of A's row into shared memory. Using float4 vectors would help here.

2. The block also loads a tile of B (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N) from global memory. Since B is stored in row-major, each row of B is contiguous. To load a tile of B that is BLOCK_K rows and BLOCK_N columns, the block can load each row of B into shared memory in a way that the columns are contiguous. Wait, perhaps the shared memory for B is stored in column-major, so that when the threads access it, they can do so in a contiguous manner. The global loads for B would be done row-wise, so each thread can load a chunk of a row of B, and then transpose it into the shared memory in column-major. Alternatively, the shared memory for B is arranged as column-major, so that when the threads access B's elements, they are contiguous in shared memory. The global loads for B would be done in a way that each thread loads a part of a row, and then the data is stored in shared memory in column-major. This requires some transposition in the shared memory storage.

Alternatively, perhaps the B tile is stored in shared memory in row-major, but the accesses are structured such that the threads can coalesce. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me proceed step by step.

The kernel structure outline:

- Each block computes a tile of C of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N (32x32).
- The block is divided into threads, say 16x16 threads (total 256 threads), so each thread handles a 2x2 area in the C tile.
- The shared memory has two tiles for A and B, each of size (BLOCK_M + 1) x (BLOCK_K) and (BLOCK_K + 1) x (BLOCK_N), but with double buffering, so two stages. Wait, the double buffering strategy says to have two stages for K, so the shared memory needs to hold two copies of A and B tiles. So the shared memory would have two A tiles and two B tiles. Wait, no, the double buffering is for the K dimension. Each iteration over K is divided into two stages, so that while one stage is being processed, the next is being loaded. So for each K iteration, the block loads the next tile into shared memory while processing the previous one. So the shared memory needs to hold two copies of the A and B tiles. So the total shared memory would be 2*(BLOCK_M * BLOCK_K + BLOCK_K * BLOCK_N). For the given values, that's 2*(32*16 + 16*32) = 2*(512 + 512) = 2048 elements, which is 2048 *4 = 8192 bytes. That's acceptable.

The kernel would loop over K in chunks of BLOCK_K, with two stages. For each iteration of K, the block loads the next A and B tiles into shared memory while processing the previous ones. This requires that the shared memory is divided into two buffers for A and B.

Now, the vectorization part: using float4 for global loads. For A, which is row-major, each thread can load a float4 (4 elements) along the row. The threads need to be arranged such that their global loads are aligned and contiguous. For example, if a thread is responsible for a certain row in A's tile, it can load a float4 every 4 elements. The alignment is 16B (since float4 is 16 bytes), so the pointers must be aligned to 16B. The code must ensure that the input tensors are aligned to 16B. The problem's strategy says to enforce this, so perhaps the kernel can assume that the pointers are aligned, or include a check.

The coalescing for B's loads: since B is treated as column-major, the accesses should be contiguous in columns. Since B is stored in row-major, this requires that the threads load B's columns in a way that their accesses are contiguous. To do this, perhaps the kernel loads B's rows into shared memory in a column-major layout. For example, each thread loads a portion of a row of B and stores it into shared memory in a column-major way. This way, when accessing B's elements from shared memory, the accesses are contiguous. The global loads for B would be done in row-major, so they are coalesced as well.

The broadcast strategy suggests using shuffle instructions to broadcast fragments from shared memory to threads. This can help reduce redundant accesses. For example, each thread loads a fragment from shared memory and then uses shuffle to share it with other threads in the block.

The guard strategy requires predication-based bounds checks when writing to C. This is necessary for edge tiles where the block may be processing a partial tile (e.g., when M or N are not multiples of BLOCK_M or BLOCK_N).

Putting this all together, the CUDA kernel would look something like this:

The kernel function would be launched with grid dimensions (ceil(M/BLOCK_M), ceil(N/BLOCK_N)), and block dimensions (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) or some other arrangement. Wait, the block dimensions need to be chosen such that the threads can cover the tiles. Let me think of the block dimensions as 16x16 threads, so each thread handles a 2x2 area in the C tile (since 32/16=2). The shared memory tiles would be divided among the threads.

The code outline:

__global__ void matmul_kernel(const float* __restrict__ A, const float* __restrict__ B, float* __restrict__ C,
                             int M, int N, int K, int lda, int ldb, int ldc) {

    // Thread and block indices
    int tx = threadIdx.x;
    int ty = threadIdx.y;
    int bx = blockIdx.x;
    int by = blockIdx.y;

    // Compute the global indices for C
    int row = bx * BLOCK_M + ty;
    int col = by * BLOCK_N + tx;

    // Shared memory for A and B tiles (double buffered)
    __shared__ float sA[2][BLOCK_M + 1][BLOCK_K]; // +1 for padding
    __shared__ float sB[2][BLOCK_K + 1][BLOCK_N]; // +1 for padding

    float Csub = 0.0f;

            sB[stage][ty][tx] = B[b_row * ldb + b_col];
        } else {
            sB[stage][ty][tx] = 0.0f;
        }

        __syncthreads();

        // Compute the dot product using the shared memory tiles
        for (int i = 0; i < BLOCK_K; ++i) {
            Csub += sA[stage][ty][i] * sB[stage][i][tx];
        }

        __syncthreads();
    }

    // Write the result to C
    if (row < M && col < N) {
        atomicAdd(&C[row * ldc + col], Csub);
    }
}

Wait, this is a rough sketch. The actual implementation needs to handle the double buffering properly, use vector loads, and ensure coalesced access. Also, the shared memory layout needs to be correct. Let me think again.

Perhaps the block dimensions are 16x16 threads, and each thread handles a 2x2 area in the C tile. The shared memory for A is BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K (32x16), and for B is BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N (16x32). The double buffering requires two copies of these, so the shared memory would be 2*(32*16 + 16*32) = 2048 floats, which is 8KB, as before.

The loop over K is divided into chunks of BLOCK_K. For each chunk, the block loads the current A and B tiles into shared memory (stage 0), then processes them while loading the next tiles into stage 1. The __syncthreads() ensures synchronization between the loads and computation.

The vectorization part: when loading A and B into shared memory, use float4 loads. For example, for A, which is row-major, each thread can load a float4 (4 elements) along the row. The thread indices need to be arranged so that the global memory addresses are aligned and contiguous.

For A's load:

Each thread in the block is responsible for a certain element in the A tile. To use vector loads, the thread's position should be such that they can load 4 elements at a time. For example, if the thread's x index is tx, then the global column index is k + tx. To load a float4, the thread would need to load from A[(row) * lda + (k + tx)], but this might not be aligned. Wait, the alignment is required for the pointers. The strategy says to enforce 16B alignment for A and B pointers. So the code can cast the pointers to float4* and load using vector types.

Alternatively, in the kernel code, when accessing A and B, the pointers are assumed to be aligned, so the code can use __ldg or __ldglobal with alignment. For example:

float4* A_vec = (float4*)A;
float4 val = A_vec[offset];

But the offset must be such that the address is 16B aligned. The thread's tx must be a multiple of 4 to ensure this. So perhaps the thread indices are arranged in such a way that tx is divided by 4, and the thread handles 4 elements at a time.

This requires more detailed thread management. Let me think of the A load:

Each thread in the block is responsible for a portion of the A tile. For example, in the A tile of size 32x16 (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K), each thread can load a 4-element chunk (float4) along the row. The total number of elements per row is 16 (BLOCK_K), so 4 elements per thread would require 4 threads per row. Since there are 32 rows (BLOCK_M), the block needs enough threads to cover this. If the block has 16x16 threads, then each thread can handle 2 rows (since 32/16=2 rows per thread in the y direction) and 1 column (since 16 columns divided by 16 threads in x direction gives 1 column per thread). Wait, perhaps the block is arranged as 16x8 threads, so each thread handles 2 columns (since 16 columns / 8 threads = 2 columns per thread). Then, using float4, each thread can load 4 elements per column. Hmm, this is getting complex. Maybe it's better to use a block of 32x16 threads, so that each thread can handle a single element in the A tile's row. But with vector loads, they can load 4 elements at a time.

Alternatively, the block is 16x16 threads, and each thread handles a 2x1 block of A (since 32 rows / 16 threads = 2 rows per thread in y direction, and 16 columns / 16 threads = 1 column per thread in x direction). To use float4, the thread can load 4 elements along the row. For example, if the thread's x index is tx, then the column is tx * 4, so each thread can load 4 elements. But this requires that the number of columns is a multiple of 4, which it is (BLOCK_K=16, which is divisible by 4). So for each thread in the A load:

The thread's position in the block is (tx, ty). The row in the A tile is ty (since there are 32 rows and 16 threads in y direction, so each thread covers 2 rows). Wait, perhaps the A tile is divided as follows:

Each thread in the block is responsible for a 2x4 block of A (since 32 rows / 16 threads = 2 rows per thread in y, and 16 columns / 4 elements per load = 4 columns per thread in x). So each thread can load 2 rows * 4 columns = 8 elements, but using float4 for each row.

This requires careful indexing. Maybe the code can be structured as:

for each stage in 0 and 1:

    // Load A into shared memory
    for each row in the A tile (BLOCK_M rows):
        for each column in the A tile (BLOCK_K columns):
            if within bounds, load into sA[stage][row][col]

But using vector loads, the code would need to loop over the columns in chunks of 4.

Alternatively, the code can use a loop unrolling for the vector loads. For example:

int a_row = bx * BLOCK_M + ty;
int a_col_start = k + tx * 4;
if (a_col_start < K) {
    float4* A_ptr = (float4*)(A + a_row * lda + a_col_start);
    sA[stage][ty][tx*4] = A_ptr[0].x;
    sA[stage][ty][tx*4 +1] = A_ptr[0].y;
    sA[stage][ty][tx*4 +2] = A_ptr[0].z;
    sA[stage][ty][tx*4 +3] = A_ptr[0].w;
}

But this requires that tx is within the range that covers the columns. This is getting quite involved. Perhaps the best way is to use a helper function or inline code to handle the vector loads with proper alignment.

Another consideration is the use of shuffle instructions for broadcasting. For example, after loading a fragment into shared memory, threads can use shuffle to share their data with others in the block to reduce redundant accesses. This is part of the broadcast strategy.

The occupancy strategy mentions unrolling the K iteration loop by a factor of 2. So instead of looping over each K chunk, the code would process two chunks at a time, which can improve IPC by reducing loop overhead. This requires that the K dimension is even, but since it's divided by BLOCK_K, which is 16, it should be manageable.

Putting all this together into code is quite involved. Let me try to draft the CUDA kernel code step by step.

First, the kernel parameters:

The kernel will be launched with gridDim.x = ceil(M / BLOCK_M), gridDim.y = ceil(N / BLOCK_N). The block dimensions are likely (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) or something similar. Let's assume the block is 16x16 threads (since 32x32 tile divided by 2 per thread in each direction).

The shared memory tiles for A and B will be double buffered, so two stages. The shared memory layout would be:

__shared__ float sA[2][BLOCK_M][BLOCK_K];
__shared__ float sB[2][BLOCK_K][BLOCK_N];

But need to ensure alignment. The +1 in the previous example was for padding, but maybe not necessary here.

The kernel function:

__global__ void matmul_kernel(
    const float* __restrict__ A,
    const float* __restrict__ B,
    float* __restrict__ C,
    int M, int N, int K,
    int lda, int ldb, int ldc) {

    // Thread indices
    int tx = threadIdx.x;
    int ty = threadIdx.y;
    int bx = blockIdx.x;
    int by = blockIdx.y;

    // Compute the global indices for C
    int row = bx * BLOCK_M + ty;
    int col = by * BLOCK_N + tx;

    // Shared memory for A and B tiles (double buffered)
    __shared__ float sA[2][BLOCK_M][BLOCK_K];
    __shared__ float sB[2][BLOCK_K][BLOCK_N];

    float Csub = 0.0f;

    for (int stage = 0; stage < 2; stage++) { // Double buffering
        int k = stage * BLOCK_K;
        if (k >= K) break;

        // Load A tile into shared memory
        for (int i = 0; i < BLOCK_M; i += blockDim.y) {
            int a_row = bx * BLOCK_M + i + ty;
            int a_col = k + tx;
            if (a_row < M && a_col < K) {
                sA[stage][i + ty][tx] = A[a_row * lda + a_col];
            } else {
                sA[stage][i + ty][tx] = 0.0f;
            }
        }

        // Load B tile into shared memory
        for (int j = 0; j < BLOCK_N; j += blockDim.x) {
            int b_row = k + ty;
            int b_col = by * BLOCK_N + j + tx;
            if (b_row < K && b_col < N) {
                sB[stage][ty][j + tx] = B[b_row * ldb + b_col];
            } else {
                sB[stage][ty][j + tx] = 0.0f;
            }
        }

        __syncthreads();

        // Compute the dot product for this stage
        for (int i = 0; i < BLOCK_K; ++i) {
            Csub += sA[stage][ty][i] * sB[stage][i][tx];
        }

        __syncthreads();
    }

    // Write the result to C
    if (row < M && col < N) {
        atomicAdd(&C[row * ldc + col], Csub);
    }
}

Wait, this is still not using vector loads or the other strategies. Let me try to incorporate the vectorization and alignment.

For vector loads in A:

Assuming A is row-major and aligned to 16B, each thread can load a float4 (4 elements) along the row. The thread's tx should be a multiple of 4 to ensure alignment. So perhaps the block's x dimension is divided by 4.

Let me restructure the block dimensions to 16x16 threads, and each thread handles 4 elements in the A column direction.

Wait, this is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a standard matrix multiplication kernel example that uses tiled approach with shared memory and vector loads, then adapt it to the given strategies.

Alternatively, I'll proceed with writing the code step by step, incorporating the strategies as best as possible.

The final code will have:

- The kernel function with the specified strategies.
- The host wrapper to launch it.
- The Python code using load_inline to compile and call the kernel.

Now, putting it all together in the required format.
