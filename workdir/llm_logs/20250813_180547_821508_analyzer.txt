You are a senior GPU performance analyst and CUDA kernel optimization advisor.
Task: Based on the provided GPU/architecture information and context, produce a set of strategies for generating the first seed kernel.
Goal: The resulting kernel should compile, run correctly, and provide a reasonable baseline performance (not maximum performance).

Rules:
1. Output format: ONLY JSON of the form {"strategies": ["...", "..."]}. No explanations, no Markdown fences, no extra text.
2. Number of strategies: ≤ k. Each strategy must be minimal, atomic, and non-overlapping; avoid vague phrases.
3. Seed focus: Prefer high-value, low-risk, easy-to-implement "foundation" strategies.
4. Hardware awareness: Use gpu_name/arch_path context to suggest concrete parameters (tile/block sizes, vector widths, double-buffering, etc.).
5. Deduplication: Do not include strategies that conflict with or duplicate any in existing_strategies.
6. Prefix each strategy with tags to help deduplication, e.g.:
   [tiling] [smem] [vectorize] [coalesce] [double-buffer] [broadcast] [unroll] [occupancy] [align] [guard] [grid] [sync] [layout]

Okay, I need to come up with five strategies for the seed kernel of a matrix multiplication on a Quadro RTX 6000. Let me start by recalling the architecture specifics. The Quadro RTX 6000 has Turing architecture, specifically Turing SMs. Each SM has 64KB of shared memory, 8 SMs per GPU, and supports up to 1024 threads per block.

The problem is a simple matrix multiplication C = A * B with dimensions M=64, K=64, N=64. Since these are small matrices, the main challenge is optimizing memory access and shared memory usage without overcomplicating things for the seed kernel.

First, tiling. The block dimensions should fit into the shared memory. Let's pick tile sizes that divide the matrix dimensions. For BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N, and BLOCK_K, maybe 16 or 32. Since 64 is divisible by both, 16x16x16 might be a good start. Wait, but maybe 32x32x16? Hmm, but the K dimension is 64. Let me think. The block tile sizes should divide the matrix dimensions. Since all are 64, using 16x16x16 would result in 4x4x4 tiles, but maybe 32x32x16 would be better for coalescing. Alternatively, maybe BLOCK_M=32, BLOCK_N=32, BLOCK_K=16. That way, each block can handle a chunk. But need to check shared memory usage. Each thread block would have two matrices in shared memory: A and B. For a tile of M=32, K=16, the size for A would be 32x16 floats. Each float is 4 bytes, so 32*16*4=2048 bytes for A, same for B, totaling 4096 bytes. Since shared memory per SM is 64KB, that's okay. So that's manageable.

Next, shared memory coalescing. The shared memory access should be coalesced. Since threads in a warp access consecutive addresses, storing the matrices in row-major order would help. Also, aligning the shared memory banks can reduce bank conflicts. Maybe using a 16-byte alignment for the shared memory arrays.

Vectorization: The GPU supports vector loads. For float4 (since float is 4 bytes), using vector loads for global memory reads. So for A and B, the threads can load 4 elements at once. But need to ensure the memory is aligned. So maybe set the load to be aligned to 16 bytes (since float4 is 16 bytes). The tensors should be aligned to that, so adding an [align] strategy for global memory access.

Coalesced global memory accesses: The threads should read in a coalesced manner. For matrix A (MxK), each thread might load a block of rows, so row-major access would be coalesced if threads are ordered properly. Similarly for matrix B's columns. So setting the thread blocks to handle tiles in a way that global memory accesses are coalesced.

Grid configuration: The grid size should launch enough blocks to cover the matrix. Since each block handles a BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N tile, the grid dimensions should be ceil(M / BLOCK_M) and ceil(N / BLOCK_N). So with M=64, N=64, and BLOCK_M=32, that's 2x2 grid blocks. So setting gridDim.x = (64+32-1)/32 = 2, same for y.

Occupancy: To keep occupancy high, using smaller blocks. If using 32x32 thread blocks (since each thread might handle a 1x1 element?), wait, actually the thread block size depends on the tile dimensions. Let me think again. Suppose each thread computes one element in the tile. For a 32x32 tile in M and N, that's 32x32 threads per block? That's 1024 threads, which is the max per block. That's okay, but maybe splitting into smaller warps? Hmm, perhaps the block dimensions are set as (BLOCK_M * BLOCK_N) threads? Or maybe a 2D grid. Wait, perhaps using a thread block size of 32x32 threads for a 32x32 tile, each thread handles one row and column. Or maybe each thread processes a sub-tile. This might need a bit more detailed setup, but for the seed strategy, choosing a block size that fits the tile and maximizes occupancy.

Double-buffering: Since the K dimension is 64, which is the inner dimension of the multiplication, double buffering could help. But maybe for the seed, start without it, but as a strategy, enable it with 2 stages. But the user mentioned double-buffer is optional. So including it as a possible strategy.

Broadcasting: For intermediate fragments, maybe using block-level broadcasting to share data between threads. For instance, when loading a tile of B into shared memory, each warp can load a portion, and then broadcast to other threads.

Guarding: Since the matrices are 64x64, the tiles might exactly fit, but if not, use predication to guard against out-of-bounds accesses. So adding a guard strategy for boundary checks.

Putting this all together into strategies with tags:

1. [tiling] Use BLOCK_M=32, BLOCK_N=32, BLOCK_K=16 for thread block dimensions. This divides 64 evenly and balances computation.

2. [smem] Use aligned row-major layout for shared memory tiles to avoid bank conflicts, aligned to 16B.

3. [vectorize] Load global memory with float4 vectors (16B-aligned) for A and B to maximize throughput.

4. [grid] Compute gridDim as (ceil(M/BLOCK_M), ceil(N/BLOCK_N)) = (2, 2) to fully cover the output matrix.

5. [align] Enforce 16B alignment for global memory pointers to enable vector loads.

Wait, but I need to check if these strategies are non-overlapping and minimal. The vectorize and align might be related, but the align ensures the pointers are aligned for vector loads, so that's separate. The tiling and grid strategies are separate. The smem's row-major and alignment is part of the first two. Maybe the occupancy isn't addressed yet, but perhaps that's okay for the seed. Alternatively, an occupancy strategy: [occupancy] Keep block size at 1024 threads (32x32) to maximize occupancy given Turing's capabilities. Since each SM can handle up to 1024 threads per block, this should be okay.

Hmm, maybe replacing one of the above with that. But the user wants 5 strategies, and existing_strategies is empty. Let me make sure the five chosen are the most critical. Let me re-order:

1. [tiling] BLOCK_M=32, BLOCK_N=32, BLOCK_K=16. (This is the core of the tile dimensions)
2. [grid] Launch grid as (2, 2) blocks for M=64, N=64 with above block sizes.
3. [smem] Use 16B-aligned row-major shared memory for A and B tiles to minimize bank conflicts.
4. [vectorize] Global loads for A and B use float4 (16B) vectorized loads.
5. [align] Enforce 16B alignment for input tensors A and B to support vectorization.

Alternatively, maybe adding a guard strategy since the matrices are exactly divisible, but perhaps better to have it as a general practice. But since M/K/N are all 64, the tiles of 32 would fit exactly, so maybe the guard isn't needed here. Hmm, maybe replacing that with occupancy.

Another thought: The Quadro RTX 6000's SM can have up to 48 SPs. To maximize occupancy, using a block size that's a multiple of 32 (threads per warp). So 32x32 threads (1024) would be a full block, which is okay. But to maintain occupancy, perhaps unroll the K dimension a bit? Like [occupancy] Unroll the K-loop by 2 to balance registers and maintain high occupancy. But that might be more advanced. Alternatively, the initial strategies should focus on the basics first.

Alternatively, a [coalesce] strategy for global memory access patterns. So instead of vectorize and align, but perhaps they are separate. The coalesced access is about how threads access memory in sequence, which the row-major and block layout would handle.

Hmm, maybe the five strategies I listed are okay. Let me check again each has a tag and parameters.

Yes, the first five I thought of (tiling, grid, smem, vectorize, align) each have tags and parameters. That should be okay.
